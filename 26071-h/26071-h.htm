<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<div class='i'>
<p>The author of this monograph has been incited to its publication by the
commendations of three of the most eminent critics and editors of
magazines in the United States, to whom it was submitted in manuscript.
In this essay, he discusses his subject from a physio-psychical
standpoint, and believes that he has kept intact the canons of
scientific investigation, observation, and discussion.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<div class='i'>
<p>In preparing The Psychical Correlation of Religious Emotion and Sexual
Desire for its second edition, the author has incorporated in it a
considerable amount of additional evidence in support of his theory. He
has carefully verified all references; he has endeavored to eliminate
all unnecessary material; and, finally, he has changed the style of the
work by dividing it into three parts, thus greatly simplifying the text.
He feels under many obligations to his critics, both to those who
thought his little book worthy of commendation, and to those who deemed
his premises and conclusions erroneous. He feels grateful to the former,
because they have caused him to believe that he has added somewhat to
the literature of science; he thanks the latter, because in pointing out
that which they considered untrue, they have forced him to a new and
more searching study of the questions involved, thereby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
strengthening his belief in the truthfulness of his conclusions.</p>

<p>To the second edition of The Psychical Correlation of Religious Emotion
and Sexual Desire, the author has seen fit to add certain other essays.
In preparing these essays for publication, he has borrowed freely from
his published papers, therefore, he desires to thank the publishers of
the New York Medical Record, Century Magazine, Denver Medical Times,
Charlotte Monthly and American Naturalist for granting him permission to
use such of his published material (belonging to them) as he saw fit.</p>

<p>The author asks the indulgence of the reader for certain repetitions in
the text. These have not been occasioned by any lack of data, but occur
simply because he believes that an argument is rendered stronger and
more convincing by the frequent use of the same data whenever and
wherever it is possible to use them. When this plan is followed, the
reader, so the author believes, becomes familiar with the author&lsquo;s
line of thought, and is, consequently, better able to comprehend and
appreciate his meaning.</p>

<p>Finally, the author has been led to the publication of these essays by a
firm belief in the truthfulness of the propositions advanced therein. He
may not live to see these propositions accepted, yet he believes that,
in the future, perhaps, in worthier and more able hands, they will be so
weightily and forcibly elaborated and advanced that their verity will be
universally acknowledged.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<div class='i'>
<p>The author, after mature consideration, has thought it advisable to
confine the subject matter of the Third Edition of Religion and Lust
almost wholly to the psychical correlation of religious emotion and
sexual desire. He has eliminated certain of the psychical problems
embraced in the First and Second Editions and has added instead a
bibliography. The student, he thinks, will find these changes of value,
especially in the matter of reference. The author has also added certain
data to the thesis of the work, as well as foot-notes; which, he thinks,
will strengthen the deductions and conclusions therein enunciated. He
has carefully and conscientiously edited and verified all notes and
quotations to be found in the book and rests satisfied in the conviction
that, whatever may be lacking in his little volume, it will not be
&ldquo;the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
THE ORIGIN OF RELIGIOUS FEELING.</h2>

<p>I believe that man originated his first ideas of the supernatural from
the external phenomena of nature which were perceptible to one or more
of his five senses; his first theogony was a natural one and one taken
directly from nature. In ideation the primal bases of thought must have
been founded, <i>ab initio</i>, upon sensual perceptions; hence, must have
been materialistic and natural. Spencer, on the contrary, maintains that
in man, &ldquo;the first traceable conception of a supernatural being is
the conception of a ghost.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Primitive man&rsquo;s struggle for existence was so very severe that his
limited sagacity was fully occupied in obtaining food and shelter; many
thousands of years must have passed away before he evolved any idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
weapons other than stones and clubs. When he arrived at a psychical
acuteness that originated traps, spears, bows and arrows, his struggle
for existence became easier and he had leisure to notice the various
natural phenomena by which he was surrounded. Man evolved a belief in a
god long before he arrived at a conception of a ghost, double, or soul.
He soon discovered that his welfare was mainly dependent on nature,
consequently he began to propitiate nature, and finally ended by
creating a system of theogony founded on nature alone.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an evident historical fact that man <i>first personified
natural phenomena</i>, and then made use of these personifications to
personify his own inward acts, his psychical ideas and conceptions. This
was the necessary process, and external idols were formed before those
which were internal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and peculiar to himself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Sun, moon, and star; mountain, hill, and dale; torrent, waterfall, and
rill, all became to him distinct personalities, powerful beings, that
might do him great harm or much good. He therefore endeavored to
propitiate them, just as a dog endeavors to get the good will of man by
abjectly crawling toward him on his belly and licking his feet. There
was no element of true worship in the propitiatory offerings of
primitive man; in the beginning he was essentially a
materialist&mdash;he became a spiritualist later on. Man&rsquo;s first
religion must have been, necessarily, a material one; he worshiped
(propitiated) only that which he could see, or feel, or hear, or touch;
his undeveloped psychical being could grasp nothing higher; his limited
understanding could not frame an idea involving a spiritual element such
as animism undoubtedly presents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Apropos of the dream birth of the soul, all terrestrial mammals dream,
and in some of them, notably the dog and monkey, an observer can almost
predicate the subject of their dreams by watching their actions while
they are under dream influence; yet no animal save man, as far as we
know, has ever evolved any idea of ghost or soul.<a name="FNanchor_B_4" id="FNanchor_B_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_4" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
It may be said, on the other hand, that since animals show,
unmistakably, that they are, in a measure, fully conscious of certain
phenomena in the economy of nature, and while I am not prepared to state
that any element of worship enters into their regard, I yet believe that
an infinitesimal increase in the development of their psychical
beings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
would, undoubtedly, lead some of them to a natural religion such as our
pithecoid ancestors practiced.</p>

<p>The Egyptians noticed, over four thousand years ago, that cynocephali,
the dog-headed apes of the Nile Valley, were in the habit of welcoming
the rising sun with dancing and with howls of joy! &ldquo;The habit of
certain monkeys (cynocephali) assembling, as it were, in full court, and
chattering noisily at sunrise and sunset, would almost justify the, as
yet, uncivilized Egyptians in intrusting them with the charge of hailing
the god morning and evening as he appeared in the east or passed away in
the west.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
An English fox-terrier of my acquaintance is very much afraid of thunder
or any noise simulating thunder. A load of coal rushing through a chute
into the coal cellar will send him, trembling and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
alarmed, to his hiding-place beneath a bed. This dog has never been shot
over, nor has he, as far as I know, ever heard the sound of a gun. I am
confident that he considers the thunder as being supernatural, and that
he would propitiate it, if he only knew how.</p>

<p>It is not probable that, at the present time, there exists a race of
people which has not formulated an idea of ghost or soul; yet in ancient
times, and up to a century or so ago, there existed many peoples who had
not conceived any idea of ghosts or doubles.</p>

<p>According to Maspero, Sayce, Champollion, and other Egyptologists, the
ancient Egyptians probably had a natural theogony long before they
arrived at any idea of a double. In the beginning they treated the
double or ghost with scant ceremony; it was only after many years that
an element of worship entered into their treatment of the ghosts of
their dead ancestors. They believed, at first, that the double dwelt
forever in the tomb along with the dead body;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
afterward, they evolved the idea that the double of the dead man
journeyed to the &ldquo;Islands of the Blessed,&rdquo; where it was
judged by Osiris according to its merits.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
We have no reason for believing that the ancient Hebrews at the time of
the Exodus had any knowledge of, or belief in, the existence of the soul
or double, yet, that they did believe in the supernatural can not be
questioned.<a name="FNanchor_C_7" id="FNanchor_C_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_7" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
When Cook touched at Tierra del Fuego, he found a people in whom there
existed mental habitudes but little above those to be found in the
anthropoid apes. They had no knowledge whatever of the soul or double
and but a dim concept of the powers of nature; they had not yet
advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
far enough in psychical development to evolve any consistent form of
natural theogony. They had only a shadowy concept of evil beings, powers
of the air that inhabited the dense brakes of the forest, whom it would
be dangerous to molest. Father Junipero Serra declares that when he
first established the Mission Dolores, the Ahwashtees, Ohlones, Romanos,
Altahmos, Tuolomos, and other Californian tribes had no word in their
language for god, ghost, or devil.<a name="FNanchor_5_8" id="FNanchor_5_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_8" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The Inca Yupangui informed Balboa that there were many tribes in the
interior which had no idea of ghost or soul.<a name="FNanchor_6_9" id="FNanchor_6_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_9" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Another writer says, that the Chirihuanas did not worship anything
either in heaven or on earth, and that they had no belief whatever in a
future state.<a name="FNanchor_7_10" id="FNanchor_7_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_10" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Modern travelers have, however, found distinct evidences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of phallic worship in certain observances and customs of this tribe.<a name="FNanchor_8_11" id="FNanchor_8_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_11" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Certain autochthons of India, when first discovered, were exceedingly
immature in religious beliefs; they had neither god nor devil; they
wandered through the woods subsisting on berries and fruits, and such
small animals as their undeveloped and feeble sagacity allowed them to
capture and slay. They did not even provide themselves with shelter,
but, in pristine nakedness, roamed the forests of the Ghauts, animals
but slightly above the anthropoid apes in point of intelligence.
&ldquo;In Central California we find,&rdquo; says Bancroft, &ldquo;whole
tribes subsisting on roots, herbs, and insects; having no boats, no
clothing, no laws, no God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_12" id="FNanchor_9_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_12" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the northwestern corner of the American continent there dwells a
primitive race,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which, for the sake of unification, I will style the Aleutians. When
these people were first discovered they were in that state of social
economics which they had reached after thousands of years of psychical
and social evolution; a primitive people, such as our own ancestors were
in the very beginning of civilization. The word civilization is used
advisedly; civilization is comparative, and its degrees begin with the
inception of man himself.</p>

<p>In their theogony, the Aleutians had arrived at an idea of the double or
soul, thus showing that their religion had progressed several steps
toward abstraction, that triumph of civilized religiosity; yet there
remained enough veneration of natural objects to show that the origin of
the religious feeling began, with them, in nature-propitiation. The
bladder of the bear, which viscus, in the estimation of the Aleutians,
is the seat of life, is at once suspended above the entrance of the
<i>kachim</i> or communal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dwelling and worshiped by the hunter who has slain the beast from which
it was taken. Moreover, when the bear falls beneath the weapons of an
Aleutian, the man begs pardon of the beast and prays the latter to
forgive him and to do him no harm. &ldquo;A hunter who has struck a
mortal blow generally remains within his hut for one or several days,
according to the importance of the slain animal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_13" id="FNanchor_10_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_13" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The first herring that is caught is showered with compliments and
blessings; pompous titles are lavished upon it, and it is handled with
the greatest respect and reverence; it is the herring-god!<a name="FNanchor_11_14" id="FNanchor_11_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_14" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Sidn&eacute;, chief god of the Aleutian theogony, on final analysis, is found
to be the Earth, mother of all things. The <i>angakouts</i>, or priests, of
this people individualize and deify, however, all the phenomena of
nature; there are cloud-gods, sea-gods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
river-gods, fire-gods, rain-gods, storm-gods, etc., etc., etc.
Everywhere, throughout all nature, the Inoit, or Aleutian system of
theology, penetrates, stripped, it is true, of much of its original
materialism, yet retaining enough to show its undoubted origin in the
sensual percepts, recepts, and concepts of its primal founders.</p>

<p>As I have observed above, the religion of these people has gained a
certain degree of abstraction, and this abstraction is further shown by
the presence of certain phallic rites and ceremonies in their religious
observances; but of this, more anon.<a name="FNanchor_D_15" id="FNanchor_D_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_15" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>In most of the tribes of Equatorial Africa, nature-worship has been
superseded by ghost-worship, devil-worship, or witch-worship, or,
rather, by ghost, devil, or witch propitiation; yet, in the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'sancity'.">sanctity</ins>
of the fetich,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which is everywhere present, we see a relic of nature-worship. Moreover,
many of these tribes deify natural phenomena, such as the sun, the moon,
the stars, thunder, lightning, etc., etc., etc., showing that here, too,
in all probability, religious feeling had its origin in nature
propitiation.</p>

<p>Abstraction also enters, to a certain extent, into the religious beliefs
of most of these negroes, in whom primal materialism has given place to
the unbridled superstition of crude spiritism. The curious habit these
people have of scraping a little bone dust from the skull of a dead
ancestor and then eating it with their food, thus, as they think,
transmitting from the dead to the living the qualities of the former, is
close kin to, and, in my opinion, is probably derived from, a worship of
the generative principle. When we take into consideration the fact that
circumcision, <i>extensio clitoridis</i>, and other phallic rites are
exceedingly common and prevalent among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
these negroes, this opinion has strong evidence in its support.<a name="FNanchor_12_16" id="FNanchor_12_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_16" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Wa-kamba may have some idea of immortality, though observers have
never been able to determine this definitely. &ldquo;The dead bodies of
chiefs are not thrown to the hyenas, as with the Masai, but are
carefully buried instead&hellip; The bodies of less important members of
the tribe are simply thrown to the hyenas.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_17" id="FNanchor_13_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_17" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In this people, religious ideas are exceedingly primitive and
indefinite. They seem to propitiate nature, however, when they wish
rain, for they offer up to the rain-spirit votive offerings of bananas,
grain, and beer, which they place beneath the trees. This seems to be
their only religious rite according to Gregory, who, in all probability
is in error. For, in the next sentence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he informs us that these negroes practice circumcision. He thinks that
they perform this operation for sanitary reasons, &ldquo;as the natives
have continually to ford streams and wade through swamps abounding in
the larv&aelig; of <i>Bilharzia haematuria</i>, the rite no doubt lessens the
danger of incurring h&aelig;maturia.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_18" id="FNanchor_14_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_18" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This is bestowing upon ignorant and savage negroes a psychical acuteness
which far transcends that of the laity of civilized races! What do the
Wa-kamba know of sanitation, h&aelig;maturia, and the larva of
Bilharzia!<a name="FNanchor_E_19" id="FNanchor_E_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_19" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
Circumcision among these people always occurs at puberty, and is,
unquestionably, a phallic rite. Parenthetically, it may be stated here
that a few of the primitive peoples still in existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
appear to have grasped the idea of the life-giving principle, and to
have established worship of the <i>functio generationis</i> without having
experienced certain preliminary psychical stages necessary for its
evolution from nature-worship. I believe, however, that this is apparent
and not real; nature-worship, very probably, at one time existed among
all these people.</p>

<p>The Kikuyu have a very elaborate system of theogony, in which all of the
phenomena of nature with which they are acquainted are deified. A goat
is invariably sacrificed to the sun when they set out on a journey, and
its blood is carried along and sprinkled on the paths and bridges in
order to appease the spirits of the forest and the river.</p>

<p>Stuhlmann places this tribe among the Bantu; from the evidence of other
observers, however, they seem to be Nilotic Hamites, and belong properly
to the Masai.<a name="FNanchor_15_20" id="FNanchor_15_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_20" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
This would account for the similarity of method in circumcision, which,
among both Kikuyu and Masai, is incomplete. Johnston calls attention to
this very peculiar method and describes it minutely in a Latin
foot-note.<a name="FNanchor_16_21" id="FNanchor_16_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_21" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The Masai are mixed devil, nature, and phallic worshipers; the last
mentioned cult being evolved, beyond question, from nature-worship. It
may be set down as an established fact that, where nature-worship does
not exist in some form or other among primitive peoples, phallic worship
is likewise absent. Indeed, such peoples generally have no religious
feeling whatever. They may have some shadowy idea of an evil spirit like
the &ldquo;<i>Aurimwantya dsongo ngombe auri kinemu</i>,&rdquo; the Old Man
of the Woods<a name="FNanchor_17_22" id="FNanchor_17_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_22" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
of the Wa-pokomo, but that is all.</p>

<p>Carl Lumholtz, writing of the Australians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
says: &ldquo;The Australian blacks do not, like many other savage
tribes, attach any ideas of divinity to the sun or moon. On one of our
expeditions the full moon rose large and red over the palm forest.
Struck by the splendor of the scene, I pointed at the moon and asked my
companions, &lsquo;Who made it?&rsquo; They answered, &lsquo;Other
blacks.&rsquo; Thereupon I asked, &lsquo;Who made the sun?&rsquo; and
got the same answer. The natives also believe that they themselves can
produce rain, particularly with the help of wizards. To produce rain
they call <i>milka</i>. When on our expeditions we were overtaken by violent
tropical storms, my blacks always became enraged at the strangers who
had caused the rain.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_23" id="FNanchor_18_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_23" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
In regard to their belief in the existence of a double or soul, the same
author sums up as follows: &ldquo;Upon the whole, it may be said that
these children of nature are unable to conceive a human soul independent
of the body, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the future life of the individual lasts no longer than his physical
remains.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_24" id="FNanchor_19_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_24" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Mr. Mann, of New South Wales, who, according to Lumholtz, has made a
thirty years&rsquo; study of the Australians, says that the natives have
no religion whatever, except fear of the &ldquo;devil-devil.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_25" id="FNanchor_20_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_25" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Another writer, and one abundantly qualified to judge, says that they
acknowledge no supreme being, have no idols, and believe only in an evil
spirit whom they do not worship. They say that this spirit is afraid of
fire, so they never venture abroad after dusk without a fire-stick.<a name="FNanchor_21_26" id="FNanchor_21_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_26" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I verily believe we have arrived at the sum total of their
religion, if a superstitious dread of the unknown can be so designated.
Their mental capacity does not admit of their grasping the higher truths
of pure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
religion,&rdquo; says Eden.<a name="FNanchor_22_27" id="FNanchor_22_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_27" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
It is simply an inherent fear of the unknown; the natural, inborn
caution of thousands of years of inherited experiences.</p>

<p>In these savages we see a race whose psychical status is so low in the
intellectual scale that they have not evolved any idea of the double or
soul. The mental capacity of the Australians, I take it, is no lower
than was that of any race (no matter how intellectual it may be at the
present time) at one period of its history. All races have a tendency
toward psychical development under favorable surroundings; it has been a
progress instead of a decadence, a rise instead of a fall! Evolution has
not ceased; nor will it end until <i>Finis</i> is written at the bottom of
Time&rsquo;s last page.</p>

<p>There are yet other people who believe in the supernatural, yet who have
no idea of immortality. When Gregory ascended the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
glacier of Mount Kenya, the water froze in the cooking-pots which had
been filled over night. His carriers were terribly alarmed by the
phenomenon, and swore that the water was bewitched! The explorer scolded
them for their silliness and bade them set the pots on the fire, which,
having been done, &ldquo;the men sat round and anxiously watched; when
it melted they joyfully told me that the demon was expelled, and I told
them they could now use the water; but as soon as my back was turned
they poured it away, and refilled their pots from the adjoining
brook.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_28" id="FNanchor_23_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_28" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Stanley declares that no traces of religious feeling can be found in the
Wahuma. &ldquo;They believe most thoroughly in the existence of an evil
influence in the form of a man, who exists in uninhabited places, as a
wooded, darksome gorge, or large extent of reedy brake, but that he can
be propitiated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by gifts; therefore the lucky hunter leaves a portion of the meat, which
he tosses, however, as he would to a dog, or he places an egg, or a
small banana, or a kid-skin, at the door of the miniature dwelling,
which is always at the entrance to the zeriba.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_29" id="FNanchor_24_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_29" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>This observer shows that he does not know the true meaning of the word
religion; the example that he gives demonstrates the fact that these
negroes <i>do</i> have religious feeling. The simple act of offering
propitiatory gifts to the &ldquo;evil influence&rdquo; is, from the very
nature of the deed, a religious observance. Furthermore, these savages
have charms and fetiches innumerable, which, in my opinion, are relics
of nature-worship. The miniature house mentioned by Stanley is common to
the majority of the equatorial tribes, and seems to be a kind of common
fetich; <i>i. e.</i>, one that is enjoyed by the entire tribe. It is
mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
by Du Chaillu, Chaill&eacute; Long, Stanley, and many others.<a name="FNanchor_25_30" id="FNanchor_25_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_30" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Du Chaillu tells of one tribe, the Bakalai, in which the women worship a
particular divinity named Njambai.<a name="FNanchor_26_31" id="FNanchor_26_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_31" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
This writer is even more inexact than Stanley, hence, we get very little
scientific data from his voluminous works. From what he says of
Njambai,<a name="FNanchor_F_32" id="FNanchor_F_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_32" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
I am inclined to believe that he is a negro Priapus; this, however, is a
conjectural belief and has no scientific warrant.</p>

<p>The Tucu&ntilde;a Indians of the Amazon Valley, who resemble the Pass&eacute;s, Jur&iacute;s,
and Muah&eacute;s in physical appearance and customs, social and otherwise, are
devil-worshipers. They are very much afraid of the <i>Jupari</i>, or devil,
who seems to be &ldquo;simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a mischievous imp, who is at the bottom of all those mishaps of their
daily life, the causes of which are not very immediate or obvious to
their dull understandings. The idea of a Creator or a beneficent God has
not entered the minds of these Indians.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_33" id="FNanchor_27_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_33" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Peruvians, at the time of the Spanish conquest, worshiped nature;
that is, the sun was deified under the name of <i>Pachacamac</i>, the Giver
of Life, and was worshiped as such. The Inca, who was his earthly
representative, was likewise his chief priest, though there was a great
High Priest, or <i>Villac Vmu</i>, who stood at the head of the hierarchy,
but who was second in dignity to the Inca.<a name="FNanchor_28_34" id="FNanchor_28_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_34" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The moon, wife of the sun, the stars, thunder, lightning, and other
natural phenomena were also deified. But, as it invariably happens,
where nature-worship is allowed to undergo its natural evolution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
certain elements of phallic worship had made their appearance. These I
will discuss later on.</p>

<p>The great temple of the sun was at Cuzco, &ldquo;where, under the
munificence of successive sovereigns, it had become so rich that it
received the name of Coricancha, or &lsquo;the Place of
Gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_35" id="FNanchor_29_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_35" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
According to the <i>relacion</i> of Sarmiento, and the commentaries of
Garcilasso and other Spanish writers, this building, which was
surrounded by chapels and smaller edifices, and which stood in the heart
of the city, must have been truly magnificent with its lavish adornments
of virgin gold!</p>

<p>Unlike the Aztecs, a kindred race of people, the Peruvians rarely
sacrificed human beings to their divinities, but, like the religion of
the former, the religion of the latter had become greatly developed
along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ceremonial lines, as we will see later on in this essay.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from Peru to Japan, from the Incas to the Ainus, yet
these widely separated races practiced religions that were almost
identical in point of fundamental principles. Both worshiped nature, but
the Peruvians were far ahead of the Ainus in civilization, and their
religion, as far as ritual and ceremony are concerned, far surpassed
that of the &ldquo;Hairy Men&rdquo; when viewed from an &aelig;sthetic
standpoint. Ethically, I am inclined to believe the religion of the
Ainus is just as high as was that of the Incas.</p>

<p>Literature is indebted to the Rev. John Batchelor for that which is,
probably, the most readable book that has ever been published about
these interesting people; from a scientific standpoint, however, this
work is greatly lacking. Many ethnologists and anthropologists
considered the Ainu autochthonic to Japan; I am forced to conclude
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
from the evidence, however, that he is an emigrant, and that he came
originally from North China or East Siberia. Be he emigrant or indigene,
one thing is certain, namely, that he has been an inhabitant of the
Japanese Archipelago for thousands of years. The oldest book in the
Japanese language has this in it anent the Ainus: &ldquo;When our august
ancestors descended from heaven in a boat, they found upon this island
several barbarous races, the most fierce of whom were the Ainu.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_G_36" id="FNanchor_G_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_36" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>The Ainu is probably the purest type of primitive man in existence. I
had been led to believe by the work of Miss Bird<a name="FNanchor_30_37" id="FNanchor_30_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_37" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
that these people were on a par with the Australians, and that they had
no religious ideas whatever. (Vogt seems to advance this conclusion
also,<a name="FNanchor_31_38" id="FNanchor_31_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_38" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
while De Quatrefages<a name="FNanchor_32_39" id="FNanchor_32_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_39" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><a name="FNanchor_H_40" id="FNanchor_H_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_40" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to have omitted this people from his tabulation. Peschel places them
among the Giliaks on the Lower Amoor, and the inhabitants of the Kurile
Islands.<a name="FNanchor_33_41" id="FNanchor_33_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_41" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
These tribes are mixed nature, devil, and phallic worshipers.)
Batchelor, however, shows very clearly that these people <i>do</i> have a
religion, and that this religion is highly developed.</p>

<p>Their chief god, or rather goddess (for the Ainus regard the female as
being higher than the male as far as gods are concerned), is the
sun.<a name="FNanchor_34_42" id="FNanchor_34_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_42" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Like the Peruvians, they regard the sun as the Creator, but they are
unlike them in the fact that they think that they cannot reach the
goddess by direct appeal. She must be addressed through intermediaries
or messengers. These messengers, the goddess of the fire, the goddess of
the water, etc., are in turn addressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
through the agency of <i>inao</i>, or prayer-sticks. This intermediary idea
is curiously like some practices of the Roman Catholic church, or,
rather, of communicants, who get the saints to carry their petitions to
God.</p>

<p>The inao are peculiar, inasmuch as nothing exactly like them is known.
The feather prayer-plumes of some of the Western Indians are used for
like purposes, but these are offered directly to the Great Spirit, and
not to intermediaries. &ldquo;Inao, briefly described, are pieces of
whittled willow wood, having the shavings attached to the
top.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_43" id="FNanchor_35_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_43" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Like the Aleutians, when these people kill a bear or other wild animal,
they propitiate its spirit by bestowing upon it the most fulsome
compliments, and, like the religion of these Indians, the religion of
the Ainus has developed along natural lines, and shows certain phallic
elements.</p>

<p>We see from the examples here given, that religious feeling had its
origin in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
idea of propitiation; in fact, that it was born in fear, and by fear was
it fostered. We see, furthermore, that man was not created with
religious feeling as a psychical trait, but that he acquired it later
on. We see, finally, that religious feeling is based, primarily and
fundamentally, on one of the chief laws of nature&mdash;self-protection.
The evolution and growth of Ethics demonstrate this beyond peradventure.</p>

<p>It is not at all probable that man in the beginning, just after his
evolution from his ape-like ancestor, had, at first, any belief whatever
in supernatural agencies. In his struggle for existence, all of his
powers were directed toward the procurement of his food and the
preservation of life; the pithecoid man was only a degree higher than
the beasts in the scale of animal life. His psychic being, as yet,
remained, as it were, <i>in ovo</i>, and a long period of time must have
elapsed before he began to formulate and to recognize a system of
theogony. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
years of experience, during which the laws of heredity and progressive
evolution played prominent parts, he took precedence over other animals,
and his struggle for existence became easier. He then had time to study
the wonderful and, to him, mysterious phenomena of nature. His limited
knowledge could not explain the various natural operations by which he
was surrounded, therefore he looked upon them as being mysterious and
supernatural. His psychical being became active and inquiring, to
satisfy which he created a system of gods which was founded on natural
phenomena. At first, the gods of primitive man were, probably, few in
number, and the chief god of all was the sun. Man early recognized the
sun&rsquo;s importance in the economy of nature; this beautiful star,
rising in the east in the morning, marching through the heavens during
the day, and sinking behind the western horizon in the evening, must
have been, to the awakening soul of man, a source<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of endless conjecture and debate. What was more natural than his making
the sun the greatest god in his system of theogony? Man recognized in
him the source of all life, and, when he arrived at an age when he could
use abstract ideation in formulating his religion, he deified the
life-giving function as he noticed it in himself; he began to worship
the generative principle. Solar worship and its direct descendant,
phallic worship, at one time or another were the religions of almost
every race on the face of the globe. Solar worship, owing to its
material quality, has long since been abandoned by civilized man; but
phallic worship, the first <i>abstract</i> religion evolved by man, has taken
deeper root; its fundamental principles are still present, though they
have their seat in our subliminal consciousness, and we are, therefore,
not actively conscious of their existence. But before entering on the
discussion of this last point, let us turn for a time to a study of
phallic worship.</p>

<hr /><p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
PHALLIC WORSHIP.</h2>

<p>Phallic worship, in some form or other, has been practiced by almost
every race under the sun. Indeed, among primitive peoples, those who do
not practice this cult are so few in number that they have, practically,
no weight whatever in a discussion of this subject. Moreover, those
primitive peoples who do not worship the generative principle, either
directly or indirectly, are without any religion whatsoever, and are the
very lowest of all mankind in point of intelligence. I have only to cite
the Tierra del Fuegians, the Bushmen, the Australians, and the Akka or
Ticki-Ticki, the Pygmies of Central Africa, to prove the truthfulness of
this assertion. There are other peoples who would serve as examples, but
it would be a work of supererogation to enumerate them to even the
casual reader.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Hancarville, in his magnificent work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
has traced the progress of the worship of the generative principle over
the entire world, while Knight, in his scholarly essay,<a name="FNanchor_36_44" id="FNanchor_36_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_44" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
has brought out its psychological truths in a manner which cannot be
surpassed. It is not my purpose to enter into a detailed account of this
cult; I propose rather to discuss its probable origin in the beginning,
and to give a brief outline of its history, as it is to be observed
among living peoples. I wish to show, also, its connection with certain
religious ceremonies and festivals of Christian peoples, which had their
origin, <i>ab initio</i>, in the worship of Priapus. And, before beginning
the discussion of this subject, I beg to remind the reader that a priest
of Priapus regarded his sistrum as being just as sacred as a Catholic
priest now considers any vessel or robe used in the service of mass, and
that the priests of Brahma look on the Lingam with as much reverence and
awe as did the Levites on the Ark of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Covenant and the Holy of Holies. Phallic worship is a religion, the
oldest <i>abstract</i> religion in existence. Fundamentally the
Creator&mdash;the Life Giver&mdash;is the phallic worshiper&rsquo;s god.
Is he very far wrong in all that is absolutely essential? &ldquo;Men
think they know because they are sure they feel, and are firmly
convinced because strongly agitated. Hence proceed that haste and
violence with which devout persons of all religions condemn the rites
and doctrines of others, and the furious zeal and bigotry with which
they maintain their own, while, perhaps, if both were equally
understood, both would be found to have the same meaning, and only to
differ in the modes of conveying it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_45" id="FNanchor_37_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_45" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico are worshipers of the generative
principle, and, like most religious sects, have evolved some very
curious rites and ceremonies. The ancient temples of Venus or Aphrodite
were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
filled with <i>hetarae</i>, who were necessary adjuncts for the proper
performance of the mysteries of Priapus. These Indians, however, will
not allow women to enter into their sacred ceremonies, but, on the
contrary, emasculate men (by occasioning organic and functional
degeneration of the sexual organs), who serve as hetar&aelig; to the
chiefs and shamans or priests.<a name="FNanchor_I_46" id="FNanchor_I_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_46" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
These androgynes are called <i>mujerados</i>, a term which aptly describes
their sexual condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to cultivate a mujerado, a very powerful man is chosen,
and he is made to masturbate excessively and ride constantly. Gradually
such irritable weakness of the genital organs is engendered that, in
riding, great loss of semen is induced. This condition of irritability
passes into paralytic impotence. Then the testicles and penis atrophy,
the hair of the beard falls out, the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
loses its depth and compass, and physical strength and energy decrease.
Inclinations and disposition become feminine. The mujerado loses his
position in society as a man. He takes on feminine manners and customs,
and associates with women; yet, for religious reasons, he is held in
high honor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_47" id="FNanchor_38_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_47" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The phallic ceremonies of the Pueblos take place in the spring, when the
life principle is exceedingly active throughout all nature.</p>

<p>In all probability the &ldquo;botes&rdquo; of the Montana Indians and
the &ldquo;burdachs&rdquo; of the Washington tribes serve as masculine
hetar&aelig; to the chiefs and medicine men, though this has not been
definitely determined. Dr. Holder described a typical &ldquo;bote&rdquo;
of the Absaroke tribe in the New York Medical Journal, 1889. This
androgyne, in many respects, resembled the mujerados of the Pueblo
Indians, and probably served a like purpose in his tribe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
According to Ross, a Konyaga woman, when she has a good-looking boy,
dresses him in girl&rsquo;s clothes and brings him up as a female. When
he arrives at a suitable age he is sent to wait on the priests of the
tribe and is introduced by them into the sacred mysteries of their cult;
in fact, he becomes a masculine hetara.</p>

<p>When we read of such things we feel pretty much as Herodotus felt when
he saw the naked women of Mendes submitting themselves openly <ins
class="trans" title="Transliteration: es epideixin anthr&ocirc;p&ocirc;n">ες
επιδειξιν ανθρωπων</ins> to the embraces of the sacred goat.<a name="FNanchor_J_48" id="FNanchor_J_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_48" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
To the Greek historian this act was simply horrible (<ins class="trans"
title="Transliteration: teras">τερας</ins>); and yet these Egyptians
experienced no repugnance whatever. To them it represented the
incarnation of the deity, and was, therefore, a sacred and holy action,
just as masculine hetarism is regarded as a holy profession among the
Konyagas. Phallic hetarism is one of the sacraments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Konyaga church, and, as such, it is held in all that reverence
and awe with which the savage devotee endows the mysteries of his
faith.<a name="FNanchor_K_49" id="FNanchor_K_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_49" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Hebrews, ancestors of one of the most ancient of the
civilized races of the earth, held it in high honor. Even wise King
Solomon, in the days of his old age, turned from the abstractedly pure
religion of his father &ldquo;to Astoreth, the goddess of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the Zidonians, and to Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites.&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_39_50" id="FNanchor_39_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_50" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
He was guilty of constructing a &ldquo;high place&rdquo; for Chemosh,
&ldquo;the abomination of Moab.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_51" id="FNanchor_40_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_51" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Any good modern biblical encyclopedia will tell the reader about
Astoreth and her worship, and what the &ldquo;high places&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;groves&rdquo; were.</p>

<p>Even the &ldquo;good kings,&rdquo; such as Asa, Amaziah, <i>et al.</i>, did
not remove the high places and the groves, for we read that,
notwithstanding the fact that these kings did that which was right in
the sight of the Lord, they did not remove the high places. In the case
of Amaziah, it is written:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not
like David, his father; he did according to all things as Joash, his
father, did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howbeit, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
did sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and burnt incense on the high places.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_52" id="FNanchor_41_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_52" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> All of the so-called
&ldquo;wicked kings&rdquo; were phallic worshipers, and both male and
female hetarism flourished during their reigns. We read of Josiah, a
&ldquo;good king,&rdquo; &ldquo;And he broke down the houses of the
sodomites (<i>kedescheim</i>) that were by the house of the Lord.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_53" id="FNanchor_42_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_53" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Here, in unmistakable terms (<i>kedescheim</i>), the phallic act of the
hetara is specified.</p>

<p>Herodotus wrote: &ldquo;Almost all mankind consort with women in their
sacred temples, except in Greece and Egypt.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_54" id="FNanchor_43_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_54" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
This is a queer mistake for a Greek to make, yet this historian is noted
for his unreliability, and we should not feel surprised at this gross
error. Concerning the Aphrodite of Abydos, what she was and what took
place in her temples, is a matter of history. Indeed, this goddess was
surnamed <i>Porne</i>! In Corinth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
delubral hetarism was openly practiced; also at Bubastis and Naucratis
in Egypt. Royal princesses were pallacides in the temple of Ammon; in
fact, they took pride in the title of <i>pallakis</i>!<a name="FNanchor_L_55" id="FNanchor_L_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_55" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
&ldquo;It is known what excessive debauchery took place in the
&lsquo;groves&rsquo; and &lsquo;high places&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Great
Goddess.&rsquo; The custom was so deeply rooted that in the grotto of
Bethlehem what was done formerly in the name of Adonis is to-day in the
name of the Virgin Mary by Christian pilgrims; and the Mussulman
<i>hadjis</i> do likewise in the sanctuaries of Mecca!&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_44_56" id="FNanchor_44_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_56" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><a name="FNanchor_M_57" id="FNanchor_M_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_57" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
But let us return to primitive peoples, from whose customs and beliefs
we can learn what our own ancestors must have believed before the besom
of civilization swept aside the crudities of savagery.</p>

<p>The Khonds of India are phallic worshipers, and, in the practice of
their religion, Priapus saves many a girl who would be, otherwise,
offered up on the bloody altars of their divinities. The pregnant woman
is sacred, hence, religious prostitution is exceedingly prevalent. But
it frequently happens that some unfortunate creature, who is not
pleasing to the shamans, is seized, tied to the stake and butchered.<a name="FNanchor_45_58" id="FNanchor_45_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_58" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
As the blood flows down and deluges the ground, &ldquo;the divine spirit
enters into the priest and inspires him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_59" id="FNanchor_46_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_59" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
This sacrifice is of itself a phallic rite; the blood-offering is
supposed to be exceedingly acceptable to Earth, the mother of all
things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Blood is the essence of the life-giving principle; hence, the essence is

<p>In point of fact, the worship of the generative principle is everywhere
prevalent in India.<a name="FNanchor_O_61" id="FNanchor_O_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_61" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>
In the Lingam, or holy altar of the Brahmins, we see a conjunction of
the male and female sexual organs, while religious prostitution, in the
shape of hetarism,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
crowds the inner courts and corridors of almost every temple in the land
with hierodules and bayaderes. The Vedas abound in references, either
direct or indirect, to phallic worship. Indeed, according to some
authorities, the Hindu Brahma is the same as the Greek Pan,<a
name="FNanchor_P_62" id="FNanchor_P_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_62" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
&ldquo;who is the creative spirit of the deity transfused through
matter.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_63" id="FNanchor_47_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_63" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of pages have been written on snake-worship, in which a
wonderful amount of metaphysical lore has been expended. Mr. Herbert
Spencer devotes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
several pages to the snake, and the reason for its appearance in the
religion of primitive peoples. He ascribes to savages a psychical
acuteness that I am by no means willing to allow them, inasmuch as he
makes them give a psychical causation for their adoption of the serpent
as a deity, such as no ignorant and uncultivated savage could have
possibly evolved. I am inclined to believe that, like all great students
and thinkers, Mr. Spencer has a hobby, and that this hobby is animism or
ancestor-worship. When he gives out, as a reason for the snake&rsquo;s
almost universal appearance in the religions of primitive peoples, that
the latter consider it an animal which has assumed the returning ghost,
double, or soul of an ancestor,<a name="FNanchor_48_64" id="FNanchor_48_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_64" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
I think that he is very much in error. There are very few primitive
folk, comparatively speaking, who believe in metempsychosis. In all
probability,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when a race, like the ancient Egyptians, for instance, had reached a
high degree of civilization, they idealized many of their religious
beliefs and customs; hence, the serpent probably lost its initial and
simple symbolical meaning, and stood for something higher and more
ethical during the reign of the great <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'Pharoahs'.">Pharaohs</ins>,
and the Golden Age of the Greeks and Latins. I am positive, however,
that the snake&rsquo;s original significance was wholly phallic in
character, and that its adoption as a symbol was simple and material, as
I explain elsewhere in this essay.<a name="FNanchor_Q_65" id="FNanchor_Q_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_65" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>

<p>I am forced to this conclusion by its presence among phallic symbols in
almost every race that practiced or practices a worship of the
generative principles. The Pueblo Indians, whom I have mentioned
elsewhere in this treatise, regard the snake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
symbol with reverence; the Moqui Indians have their sacred snake dance,
in which they worship the reptiles, handling the most vicious and
poisonous rattlesnakes with seeming impunity; the Apaches hold that
every rattlesnake is an emissary of the devil;<a name="FNanchor_49_66" id="FNanchor_49_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_66" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
&ldquo;the Piutes of Nevada have a demon deity in the form of a serpent
still supposed to exist in the waters of Pyramid Lake;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_67" id="FNanchor_50_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_67" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
on the wall of an ancient Aztec ruin at Palenque there is a tablet, on
which there is a cross standing on the head of a serpent, and surmounted
by a bird. &ldquo;The cross is the symbol of the four winds; the bird
and serpent the rebus of the rain-god, their ruler.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_68" id="FNanchor_51_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_68" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The Quiche god, Hurakan, was called the &ldquo;Strong Serpent,&rdquo;
and the sign of Tlaloc, the Aztec rain-god, was a golden snake.<a name="FNanchor_R_69" id="FNanchor_R_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_69" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>
All of these tribes are or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were worshipers of the generative principles, though, in most of them,
phallic worship has or had lost much of its original significance.<a name="FNanchor_52_70" id="FNanchor_52_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_70" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
In Yucatan and elsewhere in South and Central America, notably among the
ruins of Chichen Itza, the serpent symbol is frequently in evidence.<a name="FNanchor_53_71" id="FNanchor_53_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_71" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The Indians of the Tocantins in Brazil, as well as the Muras, Mundurucus
and Cucamas, are mixed nature and devil worshipers;<a name="FNanchor_S_72" id="FNanchor_S_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_72" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>
as a sequence, certain phallic rites are to be observed in their
religious ceremonies.</p>

 <p>Many of the native tribes of North America perform phallic rites at
puberty. James Owen Dorsey, who has made a study of the Siouan cults,
writes as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every male Dakota sixteen years old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and upward is a soldier, and is formally and mysteriously enlisted into
the service of the war prophet. From him he receives the implements of
war, carefully constructed after models furnished from the armory of the
gods, painted after a divine prescription, and charged with a missive
virtue&mdash;the tonwan&mdash;of the divinities. To obtain these
necessary articles the proud applicant is required for a time to abuse
himself and serve him, while he goes through a series of painful and
exhausting performances, which are necessary on his part to enlist
favorable notice of the gods. These performances consist chiefly of
vapor baths, fastings, chants, prayers, and nightly vigils. The spear
and the tomahawk being prepared and consecrated, the person who is to
receive them approaches the wakan man (priest), and presents a pipe to
him. He asks a favor, in substance as follows: &lsquo;Pity thou me, poor
and helpless, a <i>woman</i>, and confer on me the ability to perform
<i>manly</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
deeds.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_54_73" id="FNanchor_54_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_73" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
According to Miss Fletcher, when an Oglala girl arrives at puberty, a
great feast is prepared, and favored guests invited thereto. &ldquo;A
prominent feature in the feast is the feeding of these privileged
persons and the girl in whose honor the feast is given, with choke
cherries, as the choicest rarity to be had in the winter&hellip; In the
ceremony, a few of the cherries are taken in a spoon and held over the
sacred smoke and then fed to the girl.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_74" id="FNanchor_55_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_74" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
This is considered one of the most sacred of their feasts.</p>

<p>While discussing the phallic observances of the North American races, I
will introduce the subject of tattooing, though it properly belongs
elsewhere in this treatise.</p>

<p>At puberty, the Hudson Bay Eskimos invariably tattoo their boys and
girls. Lucien M. Turner writing of the latter, says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
&ldquo;When a girl arrives at puberty she is taken to a secluded
locality by some old woman versed in the art of tattooing, and stripped
of her clothing. A small quantity of half-charred lamp wick of moss is
mixed with oil from the lamp. A needle is used to prick the skin, and
the pasty substance is smeared over the wound. The blood mixes with it,
and in a few days a dark-bluish spot is left. The operation continues
four days. When the girl returns to the tent it is known that she has
begun to menstruate.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_75" id="FNanchor_56_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_75" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Both Eastern and Western Inoits celebrate puberty with certain rites. It
is rather difficult, however, to get them to say much about this matter,
so I will not present the evidence, meager as it is, which has been
gleaned from the works of various explorers. One can readily see that
much of it is conjecture, therefore of little scientific value.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Not far from the Place of Gold, the magnificent temple in which the
ancient Peruvians worshiped the Life Giver, was another great edifice,
styled the &ldquo;House of the Virgins of the Sun.&rdquo; This was the
domicile of the pallacides or hetar&aelig; of the Chief Priest, the
Inca. &ldquo;No one but the Inca and the Coya, or queen, might enter the
consecrated precincts&hellip; Woe to the unhappy maiden who was detected
in an intrigue! By the stern laws of the Incas she was buried alive, her
lover strangled, and the town or village to which he belonged was razed
to the ground and sowed with stones as if to efface every memorial of
his existence. One is astonished to find so close a resemblance between
the institutions of the American Indian, the ancient Roman, and the
modern Catholic. Chastity and purity of life are virtues in woman that
would seem to be of equal estimation with the barbarian and with the
civilized&mdash;yet the ultimate destination of the inmates of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
these religious houses (there were <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'hun-hundreds'.">hundreds</ins>
of them), was materially different&hellip; Though Virgins of the Sun,
they were the brides of the Inca.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57_76" id="FNanchor_57_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_76" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The monarch had thousands of these hetar&aelig; in his various palaces.
When he wished to lessen the number in his seraglios, he sent some of
them to their own homes, where they lived ever after respected and
revered as holy beings.<a name="FNanchor_58_77" id="FNanchor_58_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_77" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The religion of the Peruvians had reached a high degree of development,
and many of the crudities of simple phallic worship had either been
entirely abandoned or so idealized that they had been lost in the mists
of ritual and ceremony. For &ldquo;the ritual of the Incas involved a
routine of observances as complex and elaborate as ever distinguished
that of any nation, whether pagan or Christian.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_78" id="FNanchor_59_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_78" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Notwithstanding the fact that the descendants of the Incas have been
under the guardianship of the priests of the Catholic church for
hundreds of years, a close, careful, painstaking, and accurate observer
informs me that he has repeatedly noticed unmistakable phallic rites
interwoven with their Christian ceremonials and beliefs. The same can be
said of a kindred race and a kindred religion. Biart, writing of the
descendants of the Aztecs, says: &ldquo;In grottoes unexpectedly
discovered, I have frequently found myself in the presence of
Mictlanteuctli, at the foot of which a recent offering of food had been
placed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_79" id="FNanchor_60_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_79" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
How exceedingly basic and fundamental the worship of the generative
principle must be in Psychos itself, is indicated by these facts!</p>

<p>In the very beginnings of history we find that many races of people held
the worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the generative principle in high honor. Not only has the knowledge of
this fact come to us through the sculptured monuments of the Egyptians
and the tablets, cylinders, etc., of the Chaldeans, but it has also been
set before us by ancient historians. Speaking of the Chaldeans Herodotus
(1,199)<a name="FNanchor_T_80" id="FNanchor_T_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_80" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>
says, &ldquo;Every woman born in the country must enter once during her
lifetime the inclosure of the temple of Aphrodite, must there sit down
and unite herself to a stranger. Many who are wealthy are too proud to
mix with the rest, and repair thither in closed chariots, followed by a
considerable train of slaves. The greater number seat themselves on the
sacred pavement, with a cord twisted about their heads&mdash;and there
is always a crowd there, coming and going; the women being divided by
ropes into long lanes, down which strangers pass to make their choice. A
woman who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
has once taken her place here cannot return home until a stranger has
thrown into her lap a silver coin, and has led her away with him beyond
the limits of the sacred inclosure. As he throws the money he pronounces
these words: &lsquo;May the goddess Mylitta make thee happy!&rsquo; Now
among the Assyrians, Aphrodite&rdquo; (<i>the goddess of love, desire</i>)
&ldquo;is called Mylitta. The woman follows the first man who throws her
the money, and repels no one. When once she has accompanied him, and
<i>has thereby satisfied the goddess</i>, she returns to her home, and from
thenceforth, however large the sum offered to her, she will yield to no
one.&rdquo; Maspero declares that &ldquo;this custom still existed in
the fifth century before our era, and the Greeks who visited Babylon
about that time found it still in force.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_81" id="FNanchor_61_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_81" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>He also calls attention to the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&ldquo;we meet with a direct allusion to this same custom in the Bible,
in the <i>Book of Baruch</i>: The women, also, with cords about them, sitting
in the ways, burn bran for perfume; but if any of them, drawn by some
that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was
not worthy of herself, nor her cord broken. Ch. VI, verse 43.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phallic rites and observances entered very largely into the religion of
the Assyrians, and can be traced back, in some form or other, even to
the religion of the ancient Sumerians, the root-stock from which the
Chaldeans had their origin.</p>

<p>In the third chapter of Hebrew history according to Moses (Genesis III),
we have an unmistakable allusion to phallic worship in the use of the
serpent in the myth of man&rsquo;s temptation and fall. The serpent was
an almost universal symbol of priapic adoration throughout Egypt and
Assyria; it achieved this distinction, in all probability, from its
resemblance to the <i>instrumentum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
masculinum generationis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_U_82" id="FNanchor_U_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_82" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> In a beautiful bronze plaque, representing
Nergal, the Chaldean god of Hades, the <i>glans penis</i> of the god is
distinctly the head of the snake. A splendid drawing of this plaque by
Faucher-Gudin is given in Maspero&rsquo;s <i>Dawn of Civilization</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_83" id="FNanchor_62_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_83" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
It may be stated here that the ur&aelig;us, or asp, which was so
prominently in evidence as one of the principle signs of Egyptian
royalty, was also the symbol of the life-giving principle of Ra, the
sun-god.</p>

<p>Abraham, in all probability, instituted the rite of circumcision in
remembrance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Chaldean genital worship.<a name="FNanchor_V_84" id="FNanchor_V_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_84" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>
This sexual fetichism was eminently religious in character from its very
inception among the ancient Hebrews; yet Westermarck, in his <i>History of
Human Marriage</i>, considers this custom as being of ornamental origin.<a name="FNanchor_63_85" id="FNanchor_63_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_85" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Now, it is known beyond question of doubt that the Hebrews and
Abyssinians, who practiced this rite, covered their nakedness, hence, it
is folly to suppose that they ornamented a portion of their bodies which
always remained carefully hidden. Moreover, since it has been in use
from very ancient times &ldquo;among most of the tribes inhabiting the
African West Coast, among all the Mohammedan peoples, among the Kaffirs,
among nearly all the peoples of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Eastern Africa, among the Christian Abyssinians, Bogos, and Copts,
throughout all the various tribes inhabiting Madagascar, and, in the
heart of the Black Continent, among the Monbuttu and Akka; and since it
is practiced very commonly in Australia, in many islands of Melanesia,
in Polynesia, universally, in some parts of America, in Yucatan, on the
Orinoco, and among certain tribes in Rio Branco in Brazil;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_86" id="FNanchor_64_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_86" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and since most of these people wholly or partially hide their nakedness,
it cannot, necessarily, have had its origin in the desire for
ornamentation. Again, since the rite of circumcision among these peoples
always takes place at puberty, when <i>vita sexualis</i> begins, and is
always accompanied by other rites and ceremonies of deeply religious
significance, it must be a religious observance and phallic in its
nature. Girls, also, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
puberty, among many tribes of Africa, among certain races of the Malayan
Archipelago and South America have an operation performed upon them.
&ldquo;<i>Sunt autem gentes, quarum contrarius mos est, ut clitoris et
labia minora non exsecentur, verum extendantur, et saepe longissime
extendantur</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_87" id="FNanchor_65_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_87" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Surely such a peculiar and uncalled-for performance has a deeper
significance than mere ornamentation, and does not warrant the
expression &ldquo;<i>atque ista etiam deformatio insigne pulchritudinis
existimatur</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tattooing, among certain races, is a phallic rite, and in the Tahitians
the priapic origin of this procedure has been preserved in an
interesting myth. Hin&aelig;reeremonoi was the daughter of the god and goddess
Taaroa and Apouvaru. &ldquo;As she grew up, in order to preserve her
chasity, she was made <i>pahio</i>, or kept in a kind of inclosure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and constantly attended by her mother. Intent on her seduction, her
brothers invented tattooing, and marked each other with the figure
called Taomaro. Thus ornamented, they appeared before their sister, who
admired the figures, and, in order to be tattooed herself, eluding the
care of her mother, broke the inclosure that had been erected for her
preservation, was tattooed, and became, also, the victim to the designs
of her brothers. Tattooing thus originated among the gods, and was first
practiced by the children of Taaroa, their principle deity. <i>In
imitation of their example, and for the accomplishment of the same
purposes it was practiced among men.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_W_88" id="FNanchor_W_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_88" class="fnanchor">[W]</a><a name="FNanchor_66_89" id="FNanchor_66_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_89" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>With very few exceptions, primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
peoples, wherever found, have given or still give unmistakable evidence
of a knowledge of phallic worship in some form or other. Many of them
still practice it, generally combined with the religion from which it
was evolved, <i>i. e.</i>, sun worship. The Ainu of Japan is a notable
example of a race whose religion shows the presence of the elements of
both worships. The religion of this remarkable people, notwithstanding
the fact that it has become decidedly ethical (they having arrived at a
knowledge of the good and evil principles), shows its sun birth.<a name="FNanchor_X_90" id="FNanchor_X_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_90" class="fnanchor">[X]</a>
Until very recently the <i>couvade</i> existed in full force and vigor.
&ldquo;As soon as a child was born, the father had to consider himself
very ill, and had, therefore, to stay at home, wrapped up, by the fire.
But the wife, poor creature! had to stir about as much and as quickly as
possible. The idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
seems to have been that <i>life was passing from the father into his
child</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_91" id="FNanchor_67_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_91" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Among Slavonic races in early times, the worship of the generative
principle was almost universal. This continued, in a measure, even after
the establishment of Christianity, and we find phallic rites
masquerading in the garb of Christian observances as late as the
sixteenth century in parts of Russia and Hungary. Westermarck, in his
chapter on the human rut season in primitive times, says: &ldquo;Writers
of the sixteenth century speak of the existence of certain festivals in
Russia, at which great license prevailed. According to Pamphil, these
annual gatherings took place, as a rule, at the end of June, the day
before the festival of St. John the Baptist, which in pagan times was
that of a divinity known by the name of Jarilo, corresponding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the Priapus of the Greeks.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_92" id="FNanchor_68_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_92" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
If my memory serves me correctly, Wapp&auml;us says that a like festival
was in existence among the Hungarians two hundred years ago.<a name="FNanchor_69_93" id="FNanchor_69_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_93" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
To this day certain religious sects of Russia and Hungary are in the
habit of holding orgies at which all the ceremonies of the ancient
Liberalia, Floralia, and Saturnalia are duplicated. These devotees claim
that, when they have reached the acme of religious enthusiasm, the
spirit of God directs them, hence their licentious and lustful acts
cannot be immoral.</p>

<p>When Great Britain was invaded and conquered by northern savages, the
latter, unquestionably, introduced their own religious beliefs, which
were largely phallic in character. The Teutonic god Fr&eacute;a was the same as
the Latin Priapus; while Friga, from whom our Friday gets its name,
because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
this day was sacred to her, was the Teutonic Venus. Fr&eacute;a is
called Freyr in old Norse, and in old German, Fro.</p>

<p>Among the Swedes he was worshiped under the name of Fricco, and a statue
of him at Upsala represented him in the characteristic attitude of the
god of procreation. &ldquo;<i>Tertius est Fricco, pacem voluptatemque
largiens mortalibus, cujus etiam simulachrum fingunt ingenti
priapo.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_94" id="FNanchor_70_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_94" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
From this god a vulgar word for copulation had its origin. This word is
in use to-day among the descendants of the Anglo-Saxons, thus proving
that the worship of the generative principle was in vogue among our own
immediate ancestors.</p>

<p>Statuettes of Priapus, bronzes representing the sexual organs, and
pottery covered with phallic scenes have been found all over England.
These relics are remembrances of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the Roman occupation when the worship of Priapus prevailed. In the
parish of Adel, Yorkshire, was found an altar erected to Priapus, who
seems to be called in this instance Mentula. At this place were found
many other priapic relics, such as lamps, bracelets, amulets, etc.,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_71_95" id="FNanchor_71_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_95" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Several images of the triple phallus, as well as the single phallus,
have been brought to light in London; also phallic lamps, bracelets,
etc.</p>

<p>All over England the Anglo-Saxon Fr&eacute;a, or Friga, has left remembrances
of his or her worship in place-names. Fridaythorpe in Yorkshire, and
Friston (Fr&eacute;a&rsquo;s stone), which occurs in several parts of England,
are examples. &ldquo;We seem justified in supposing that this and other
names commencing with the syllable Fri or Fry, are so many monuments of
the existence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
phallic worship among our Anglo-Saxon forefathers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_96" id="FNanchor_72_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_96" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
There are other words in the English language which point directly to
this ancient religion; for instance, <i>fascinate</i> and <i>fascination</i>.
These words were derivede directly from the Latin word <i>fascinum</i>, which
was one of the names of the male organ of generation. The fascinum was
worn suspended from the necks of women, and was supposed to possess
magical powers; hence, to <i>fascinate</i>. Horace makes use of the word in
Priapeia:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Placet, Priape? Qui sunt arboris coma</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sotes, sacrum revinct pampino caput,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ruber sedere cum rubente fascino.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_97" id="FNanchor_73_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_97" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the worship of the fascinum was in vogue during the eighth
century<a name="FNanchor_Y_98" id="FNanchor_Y_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_98" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Italy and in other countries under the religious jurisdiction of the
Pope, the following from the <i>Judicia Sacerdotalia Criminibus</i>, clearly
indicates: &ldquo;If any one has performed incantation to the
<i>fascinum</i>, or any incantation whatever, except one who chaunts the
Creed or the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, let him do penance on bread and water
during three Lents.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_99" id="FNanchor_74_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_99" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><a name="FNanchor_Z_100" id="FNanchor_Z_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_100" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
During the ninth century the Council of Chalons promulgated a similar
law, and in the twelfth century Buchardus repeats it, thus showing that
the worship of the generative principle was continuous throughout that
time.<a name="FNanchor_75_101" id="FNanchor_75_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_101" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
That the worship of the fascinum was in vogue as late as 1247 is proven
by the statutes of the Synod of Mans, which declare that he who worships
the fascinum shall be seriously dealt with.<a name="FNanchor_76_102" id="FNanchor_76_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_102" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, as late as 1268, according to the Chronicles of Lanercroft,
the people were in the habit of rubbing two pieces of wood together
until fire was produced. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the same time an image of the phallus was elevated, and certain prayers
were said to Priapus. This was the famous &ldquo;need fire,&rdquo; and
was obtained in this way in order that it might have the power of saving
the cattle from the plague. Need fire was produced in this manner in the
Highlands as late as 1356, at which time a cattle plague ravaged the
country side. In Inverkeithing, a Catholic priest gathered all the young
girls of the village and made them dance around a statue of Priapus. He
himself led the dance, carrying a large wooden image of the phallus, and
excited these medieval bacchantes to licentious movements and actions by
his own actions and language.</p>

<p>When called to account by his bishop, he excused his action by stating
that such performances were common in his parish. These phallic
observances occurred in Easter week, March 29-April 15, 1282.<a name="FNanchor_77_103" id="FNanchor_77_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_103" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In Ireland, the female sexual organs seem to have been the symbol of
phallic worship most in use. In the arches over the doorways of
churches, a female figure, with the person fully exposed, was invariably
so placed that the external organs of generation at once caught the eye.
These figures were called <i>Shela-na-gig</i>, which in Irish means
&ldquo;Julian the giddy.&rdquo; Sometimes these images were placed on
the walls and used as caryatides. From this symbol the horseshoe&rsquo;s
power to ward off evil and bring good luck has been evolved. The people
in olden times were in the habit of painting, or sketching with
charcoal, drawings of the female genitalia over the doors of their
houses to ward off bad luck. These drawings were necessarily rude, and
probably resembled a horseshoe more than they did the object for which
they were intended. In course of time, when the symbol had lost its
original significance, the horseshoe entirely took the place of the
phallic image.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Herodotus says that Sesostris, king of Egypt, was in the habit of
erecting pillars in the countries conquered by his armies, on which he
had the female genitals engraved in order to show his contempt.<a name="FNanchor_78_104" id="FNanchor_78_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_104" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
I think that the historian misinterprets the meaning of the pillars; the
Egyptians were phallic worshipers, and these obelisks were, in all
probability, altars to Priapus.</p>

<p>The beneficent influence of this particular phallic symbol has been well
brought out in several classical stories. When Ceres was wandering over
the world in her search after Proserpine, she came to the house of a
peasant woman, Baubo by name. Baubo saw that the goddess was heart-sick
and miserable, so she offered her a drink of cyceon (<ins class="trans" title="Transliteration: kyke&ocirc;n">κυκεων</ins>).
The goddess refused the refreshing mixture, and continued her
lamentations. Fully believing in the virtue and efficacy of the symbol,
Baubo lifted her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
robe and showed Ceres her genitals.<a name="FNanchor_AA_105" id="FNanchor_AA_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_105" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>
The goddess burst into laughter and at once drank the cyceon.<a name="FNanchor_79_106" id="FNanchor_79_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_106" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
The same superstition appears in a celebrated book of the sixteenth
century, <i>Le Moyen de Parvenir</i>. The author of the &ldquo;Worship of the
Generative Powers&rdquo; gives the following instructive extract from
this work:</p>

<p><i>Herm&egrave;s. On nomme ainsi ceux qui n&rsquo;ont point vu le con de leur
femme ou de leur garce. Le pauvre valet de chez nous n&rsquo;&eacute;toit donc
pas coquebin; il eut beau le voir.</i></p>

<p><i>Varro. Quand?</i></p>

<p><i>Herm&egrave;s. Attendez, &eacute;tant en fian&ccedil;ailles, il vouloit prendre le cas de sa
fianc&eacute;e; elle ne le vouloit pas: il faisoit le malade, et elle lui
demandoit: &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;y a-t-il, mon ami?&rdquo; &ldquo;H&eacute;las, ma
mie, je suis si malade, que je n&rsquo;en puis plus; je mourrai si je ne
vois ton cas.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vraiment voire?&rdquo; dit-elle.
&ldquo;H&eacute;las!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
oui, si je l&rsquo;avois vu, je gu&eacute;rirois.&rdquo; Elle ne lui
voulut point montrer; &agrave; la fin, ils furent mari&eacute;s. Il
advint, trois ou quatre mois apr&egrave;s, qu&rsquo;il fut fort malade;
et il envoya sa femme au m&eacute;dicin pour porter de son eau. En
allant, elle s&rsquo;avisa de ce qu&rsquo;il lui avoit dit en
fian&ccedil;ailles. Elle retourna vitement, et se vint mettre sur le
lit; puis, levant cotte et chemise lui pr&eacute;senta son cela en belle
vue, et lui disoit: &ldquo;Jean, regarde le con, et te
gu&eacute;ris.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_107" id="FNanchor_80_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_107" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton writes to Richard Payne Knight from Naples in the
year 1781, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having last year made a curious discovery, that in a province of
this kingdom, not fifty miles from its capital, a sort of devotion is
still paid to Priapus, the obscene divinity of the ancients (though
under another denomination), I have thought it a circumstance worth
recording; particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as it offers a fresh proof of the similitude of the Popish and Pagan
religion, so well observed by Dr. Middleton in his celebrated Letter
from Rome; therefore I mean to deposit the authentic proofs of this
assertion in the British Museum when a proper opportunity shall
offer.&rdquo; Sir William goes on to relate how he found many phallic
amulets, charms, etc., in the possession of the people, and then
describes the votive offerings laid upon the altar at a feast given in
honor of Saints Cosmus and Damianus, in a church called by their names.
The offerings were waxen images of the phallus. &ldquo;The vows are
chiefly presented by the female sex,&rdquo; continues he, &ldquo;and
they are seldom such as represent legs, arms, etc., but most commonly
the male parts of generation. A person who was at this f&ecirc;te in the
year 1780, told me that he heard a woman say, at the time she presented
a vow, &lsquo;<i>Santo Cosimo benedetto, cosi lo voglio.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_81_108" id="FNanchor_81_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_108" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
This church was in Isernia, a little village about fifty miles from
Naples, and away from the direct line of travel, hence its inhabitants
saw little of the world, and therefore kept to their old customs longer
than their more favored neighbors. Thus it happened that, even in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, Priapus had his votaries almost
within the shadow of the Vatican! These phallic rites were finally
abolished by episcopal command.</p>

<p>One of the most common amulets or charms against <i>jettitura</i>, or the
&ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of every Italian, is a little
coral hand. The middle finger of this hand is extended, thus
representing the penis, while the other fingers are closed on the palm,
thus representing the testicles. In ancient times, when a man extended
his hand, closed in this manner, it was a gesture of insult and anger;
to-day this gesture is only made in derision and contempt. The hand
closed in this way, or, rather, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
thumb projecting between the first and second fingers (another very
common phallic symbol or sign), was called a &ldquo;fig&rdquo;; hence,
the old expression of contempt and indifference, &ldquo;a fico for you,
sir,&rdquo; now modernized into &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a
fig.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AB_109" id="FNanchor_AB_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_109" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a></p>

<p>France, as well as Italy, had her phallic charms and her phallic saints.
Priapus was a god to the ancients&mdash;to the people of the Middle Ages he
was a saint. According to M. Dulaure, in the south of France, Provence,
Languedoc, and the Lyonnais, he was worshiped under the name of St.
Foutin. This name is derived from that of the first bishop of Lyons,
Fotinus, to whom the people had transferred (as they have done to many
other sainted individuals) the distinguishing characteristics of a god;
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
this instance, Priapus. At Lyons there was an immense wooden phallus,
and the women were in the habit of scraping this image, and then
steeping the wood-dust in water, which they drank as a remedy against
barrenness. Sometimes they gave it to the men in order to stimulate
sexuality or sensuality. At Varailles, in Provence, waxen images of the
male and female sexual organs were offered to St. Foutin, and, since
these images were suspended from the ceiling and moved by every vagrant
current of air, the effect was sometimes very astonishing.
&ldquo;<i>T&eacute;moin Saint Foutin de Varailles en Provence, auquel sont
d&eacute;di&eacute;es les parties honteuses de l&rsquo;un et de l&rsquo;
autre sexe, form&eacute;es en cire; le plancher de la chapelle en est
fort garni, et, quand le vent les fait entrebattre, cela d&eacute;bauche
un peu les d&eacute;votions &agrave; l&rsquo;honneur de ce
Saint.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82_110" id="FNanchor_82_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_110" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>This worship at Varailles was identical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with that of Isernia; the votive offerings were waxen images or models
of the genital organs, while the saints differed only in name, not in
character. At Embrun the worship of St. Foutin was a little different.
The women at this last mentioned place poured wine on the phallus; this
wine was collected in a bucket, and, when it became sour, it was used as
a medicine for barrenness.</p>

<p>When Embrun was besieged and taken by the Protestants in 1585, this
phallus was found among the other sacred relics, and its head &ldquo;was
red with the wine which had been poured upon it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_83_111" id="FNanchor_83_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_111" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
In the church of St. Eutropius, at Orange, a large phallus covered with
leather was seized and burnt by the Protestants in 1562. Dulaure says
that the sexual organs were objects of worship at Porighy, Viviers,
Vendre in the Bourbonnais, Cives, Auxerre, Puy-en-Velay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and at hundreds of other places. Some of these phalli were recreated as
fast as they were worn away by zealous devotees. They were so arranged
in the walls of the churches that, &ldquo;as the phallic end in front
became shortened (by scrapings), a blow from a mallet from behind thrust
it forward, so that it was restored to its original length.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_112" id="FNanchor_84_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_112" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In the public square of Batavia there was formerly kept a bronze cannon
which had been captured from the natives. The touch-hole of this piece
of ordnance was made in the shape of a phallic hand or
&ldquo;fig,&rdquo; which I have described elsewhere. The barren Malay
women were in the habit of seating themselves on this hand in order that
they might become pregnant.<a name="FNanchor_AC_113" id="FNanchor_AC_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_113" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a>
An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
analogous custom was prevalent in France and elsewhere in Europe during
the Middle Ages. This habit led to sexual abuses, and was finally
condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities. Indeed, the Church
inflicted severe penances on the women who were guilty of using phalli:
&ldquo;<i>Mulier qualique molimine aut se ipsam aut cum altera fornicans
tres annos poeniteat, unum ex his pane et aqua. Cum sanctimoniali per
machinam fornicans, annos septem poeniteat, duos ex his in pane et
aqua.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_85_114" id="FNanchor_85_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_114" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
We see by this that nuns were more severely punished than were other
women.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
This use of the phallus is mentioned in the Bible, where it is bitterly
condemned by one of the prophets: &ldquo;Thou hast also taken thy fair
jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest
to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_86_115" id="FNanchor_86_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_115" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Finally, it was the custom of the young girls of France during the
Middle Ages (like the maidens of certain savage races), who were on the
eve of marriage, to offer up to St. Foutin their last maiden robes. From
the evidence here adduced, we see that phallic worship existed in some
parts of Europe as late as the latter half of the eighteenth century,
and that it was almost universal during the Middle Ages. According to
Becan,<a name="FNanchor_87_116" id="FNanchor_87_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_116" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Golnitz,<a name="FNanchor_88_117" id="FNanchor_88_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_117" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and other historians, there were several other phallic
saints besides St. Foutin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
who were worshiped in Belgium, Spain, Germany and other European
countries; but, since their adoration was similar to that of St. Foutin,
I do not think it necessary to give a description of it here. It has
been shown conclusively that worship of the generative principle was in
vogue among the Latins, the Greeks, the ancient Germans, the Saxons, the
Danes, the Gauls, the Iberians, the Picts, the Celts and the Britons. It
has been demonstrated, also, that vestiges of phallic worship existed in
England, France, Italy, Spain and Germany during the Middle Ages. As
late as the latter part of the eighteenth century wax images of the
phallus were used as votive offerings in the town of Isernia, not many
miles from Naples; the beribboned Maypole of our Mayday festival is but
the flower decked phallus of the Roman matrons; charms against
<i>jettitura</i>, &ldquo;the evil eye,&rdquo; little coral hands with the
middle finger extended (in ancient days one of the most common symbols
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Priapus) can still be purchased in the streets of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_AD_118" id="FNanchor_AD_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_118" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a>
&ldquo;This worship&rdquo; (that of Priapus) &ldquo;which was but part
of that of the generative powers, appears to have been the most ancient
of the superstitions of the human race, and has prevailed more or less
among all known peoples before the introduction of Christianity; and,
singularly enough, <i>so deeply it seems to have been implanted in human
nature</i> that even the promulgation of the gospel did not abolish it, for
it continued to exist, accepted and often encouraged by the medieval
clergy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_89_119" id="FNanchor_89_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_119" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>So very ancient was the inception of the worship of the generative
principle that we have some reason for believing that even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the cave-dwellers practiced this cult. It was stated in the <i>Moniteur</i>,
January, 1865, that &ldquo;in the province of Venice, in Italy,
excavations in a bone-cave have brought to light, beneath ten feet of
stalagmite, bones of animals, mostly post-tertiary, of the usual
description found in such places, flint implements, with a needle of
bone having an eye and point, and a plate of argillaceous compound, on
which was scratched a rude drawing of the phallus.&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_90_120" id="FNanchor_90_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_120" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Thus we see that,
possibly, from the time of the cave-dwellers to almost the beginning of
the nineteenth century, phallic worship existed in Southern Europe! From
the Sagas, folklore tales, and myths of the Norse we have every reason
for believing that it existed for almost as great a length of time in
Northern Europe. That in Western Europe, before and during the Middle
Ages, it flourished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in a variety of forms, we have unimpeachable testimony.</p>

<p>In this brief outline of phallic worship I have endeavored to show that
the worship of the generative principle has been universal; that it is
still practiced by primitive peoples, and that vestiges of it lingered
among certain civilized peoples until, comparatively speaking, a recent
time. In order to show what a height of idealization and abstraction it
had reached at a time when Greece stood at the head of the civilized
world, I will close this part of my essay with the following quotation
from Knight&rsquo;s strong, erudite, and exhaustive treatise: &ldquo;The
ancient theologists &hellip; finding that they could conceive no idea of
infinity, were content to revere the Infinite Being in the most general
and efficient exertion of his power&mdash;attraction; whose agency is
perceptible through all matter, and to which all motion may, perhaps, be
ultimately traced. His agency being supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to extend through the whole material world, and to produce all the
various revolutions by which its system is sustained, his attributes
were, of course, extremely numerous and varied. These were expressed by
various titles and epithets in the mystic hymns and litanies, which the
artists endeavored to represent by various forms and characters of men
and animals. The great characteristic attribute was represented by the
organ of generation in that state of tension and rigidity which is
necessary to the due performance of its functions. Many small images of
this kind have been found among the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii,
attached to bracelets, which the chaste and pious matrons of antiquity
wore round their necks and arms. In these the organ of generation
appears alone, or accompanied by the wings of incubation, in order to
show that the wearer devoted herself wholly and solely to procreation,
the great end for which she was ordained. So expressive a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
symbol, being constantly in view, must keep her attention fixed on its
natural object, and continually remind her of the gratitude she owed the
Creator for having taken her into his service, made her partaker of his
most valuable blessings, and employed her as the passive instrument in
the exertion of his most beneficial power. The female organs of
generation were revered as symbols of the generative power of nature or
matter, as the male&rsquo;s were of the generative powers of
God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_91_121" id="FNanchor_91_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_121" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
THE PSYCHICAL CORRELATION OF RELIGIOUS EMOTION AND SEXUAL DESIRE.</h2>

<p>That there exists a relationship between the cultivated ethical emotion,
religious feeling, and the essentially natural physio-psychical
function, sexual desire or <i>libido</i>, is a fact noticed and commented on
by many thinkers and writers. The literature of the subject is, however,
exceedingly fragmentary and disconnected, no author (as far as I have
been able to determine) having devoted as much as one thousand words to
the consideration of this very interesting psychical phenomenon. Hence,
my data have been gathered from many sources, which are as diversified
as they are numerous.</p>

<p>Beyond a question of doubt, man becomes religiously enthused most
frequently either early in life, when pubescence is, or is about to be,
established, or late in life, when sexual desire has become either
entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
extinct or very much abated. Young boys and girls are exceedingly
impressionable at, or just before, puberty, and are apt to embrace
religion with the utmost enthusiasm. A distinguished evangelist declares
that &ldquo;men and women seldom or never enter into the kingdom of God
after they have arrived at maturity. Out of a thousand converts, seven
hundred are converted before they are twenty years old.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_122" id="FNanchor_92_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_122" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The Roman Catholic church is keenly alive to these facts, therefore
requires the rite of confirmation to be administered, if possible, to
its would-be communicants at, or before, the age of puberty.<a name="FNanchor_AE_123" id="FNanchor_AE_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_123" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<p>Of all the insanities of the pubescent state, erotomania and religious
mania are the most frequent and the most pronounced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Sometimes they go hand in hand, the most inordinate sensuality being
coupled with abnormal religious zeal. A young woman of my acquaintance,
whose conduct has given rise to much scandal, is, at times, a
reincarnate Messalina, while at other times she is the very embodiment
of ethical and religious purity. Another young girl, in whom <i>vita
sexualis</i> was about to be established, became religiously insane and had
delusions in which she declared that she was in heaven and sitting at
the right hand of God. She declared this over and over again, while
shamelessly committing manustrupation! Krafft-Ebing calls attention to
this relation between religious and sexual feeling in
psycho-pathological states. &ldquo;It suffices,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;to recall how intense sensuality makes itself manifest in the
clinical history of many religious maniacs; the motley mixture of
religious and sexual delusions that is so frequently observed in
psychoses (<i>e. g.</i>, in maniacal women who think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
they are or will be the mother of God), but particularly in masturbatic
insanity; and finally, the sexual, cruel self-punishment, injuries,
self-castrations, and even self-crucifixions, resulting from abnormal
religio-sexual feeling.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_93_124" id="FNanchor_93_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_124" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>An example of the last mentioned self-immolation (self-crucifixion) is
given by Berghierri, and is a remarkable instance of the
interchangeableness of religious emotion and sexual desire in
psychopathic individuals. The man in question, who had been intensely
sensual, manufactured a cross, nailed himself to it, and ingeniously
managed to suspend himself and cross from the window of his sleeping
apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All through the history of insanity the student has occasion to
observe this close alliance of sexual and religious ideas; an alliance
which may be partly accounted for because of the prominence which
sexual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
themes have in most creeds, as illustrated in ancient times by the
phallus worship of the Egyptians, the ceremonies of the Friga cultus of
the Saxons, the frequent and detailed reference to sexual topics in the
Koran and several other books of the kind, and which is further
illustrated in the performances which, to come down to a modern period,
characterize the religious revival and camp-meeting as they tinctured
their medieval model, the M&uuml;nster Anabaptist movement.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_125" id="FNanchor_94_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_125" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Men, owing to their greater freedom, soon learn the difference of the
sexes and the delights of sexual congress; women, hedged in by
conventionalities and deterred by their innate passivity, remain, for
the most part, in ignorance of sexual knowledge until their marriage.
For this reason it happens that very many more women than men experience
religious emotion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<i>Young married men and women, who are in perfect sexual health, and who
have not experienced religion before marriage, seldom give this emotion
a single thought until late in life, when both libido and vita sexualis
are on the wane or are extinct.</i> <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's
Note: The original read 'Voltair'.">Voltaire</ins> cynically, though
truthfully, observes that when woman is no longer pleasing to man she
then turns to God. A woman who has been disappointed in love almost
invariably seeks consolation in religion. The virtuous unmarried woman,
who has been unsuccessful in the pursuit of a husband, invariably turns
to God and religion with impassioned zeal and energy.</p>

<p>Ungratified, or, rather, <i>unsatisfied</i>, sensuality very frequently gives
rise to great religio-sexual enthusiasm. The circumcised foreskin of
Christ, where it was and what had become of it, was a source of
continual worriment to the nun Blanbekin; in an ecstacy of ungratified
<i>libido</i>, St. Catherine of Genoa would frequently cast herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on the hard floor of her cell, crying: &ldquo;Love! love! I can endure
it no longer;&rdquo; St. Armelle and St. Elizabeth were troubled with
<i>libido</i> for the child Jesus;<a name="FNanchor_95_126" id="FNanchor_95_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_126" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
an old prayer is quite significant: &ldquo;Oh, that I had found thee,
Holy Emanuel; <i>Oh, that I had thee in my bed to bring delight to body
and soul!</i> Come and be mine, and my heart shall be thy
resting-place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_96_127" id="FNanchor_96_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_127" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Francis Parkman calls attention to the fact that the nuns sent over to
America in colonization days were frequently seized with religio-sexual
frenzy. &ldquo;She heard,&rdquo; writes he of Marie de
l&rsquo;Incarnation, &ldquo;in a trance, a miraculous voice. It was that
of Christ, promising to become her spouse. Months and years passed, full
of troubled hopes and fears, when again the voice sounded in her ear,
with assurance that the promise was fulfilled, and that she was, indeed,
his bride. Now ensued phenomena which are not infrequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
among Roman Catholic female devotees, when unmarried, or married
unhappily, and <i>which have their source in the necessities of a
woman&rsquo;s nature</i>.&rdquo; (The italics are my own.) &ldquo;To her
excited thought, her divine spouse became a living presence; and her
language to him, as recorded by herself, is of intense passion. She went
to prayer, agitated and tremulous, as if to a meeting with an earthly
lover: &lsquo;Oh, my Love,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;when shall I
embrace you? Have you no pity on the torments that I suffer? Alas! alas!
my Love, my Beauty, my Life! Instead of healing my pain, you take
pleasure in it. Come, let me embrace you, and die in your sacred
arms!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_97_128" id="FNanchor_97_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_128" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
The historian remarks that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
&ldquo;holy widow,&rdquo; as her biographers call her, is an example,
and a lamentable one, of the tendency of the erotic principle to ally
itself with high religious excitement and enthusiasm. Further along he
says that &ldquo;some of the pupils of Marie de l&rsquo;Incarnation,
also, had mystical marriages with Christ; and the impassioned rhapsodies
of one of them being overheard, she nearly lost her character, as it was
thought that she was apostrophizing an earthly lover.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_129" id="FNanchor_98_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_129" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The instances of religio-sexual outbursts in nuns and Roman Catholic
female devotees who lead celibate lives are very numerous; I will,
however, call attention to but one other: St. Veronica was so much in
love with the divine lion that she took a young lion to bed with her,
fondled and kissed it, and allowed it to suck her breasts.<a name="FNanchor_99_130" id="FNanchor_99_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_130" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Throughout sacred literature, beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
with the Bible itself, religio-sexual feeling is very much <i>en
evidence</i>. Hosea married a prostitute because&mdash;so he
declared&mdash;God commanded him so to do. If Solomon&rsquo;s beautiful
song is typical of the Church and the Christ (as some theologians
teach), then it is an unmistakable instance of religio-sexual feeling;
religious emotion and sexual desire walk hand in hand through the
measures of this impassioned verse. Circumcision, now eminently a
religious ceremony, was, unquestionably, a sexual fetich and a phallic
rite, which has been handed down from antiquity, when all the world were
phallic worshipers! The very pillars set up by the patriarchs in
commemoration of certain events were but rude images of the phallus,
while not a few of the mysteries of the Holy of Holies itself were but
vestiges of Chaldean and Egyptian genital worship!<a name="FNanchor_AF_131" id="FNanchor_AF_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_131" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
That a relationship between, and an interchangeableness of, these two
widely dissimilar psychical operations, <i>i.e.</i>, religious emotion and
sexual desire, does exist, there can be no doubt.<a name="FNanchor_AG_132" id="FNanchor_AG_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_132" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a>
Now, what is the cause of, the reason for, this relationship?
Mantegazza, Maudsley, Schleiermacher, Krafft-Ebing, and many others have
endeavored, incidentally, to assign reasons for this relationship, but
have, in my opinion, signally failed. Spitzka has tentatively, and
without elaborating his idea in the least, suggested a theory which, I
believe, solves the problem in every essential point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Says he in &ldquo;Insanity,&rdquo; page 39: This &ldquo;alliance&rdquo;
(between religious emotion and <i>libido</i>) &ldquo;may be partly accounted
for because of the prominence which sexual themes have in most creeds,
as illustrated in ancient times by the phallus worship of the Egyptians,
the ceremonies of the Friga cultus of the Saxons, the frequent and
detailed reference to sexual topics in the Koran and several other books
of the kind, etc.&rdquo; Dr. Spitzka does not enter into any discussion
of the matter; he simply asserts his belief in the cause of the
relationship, and then dismisses the subject without further comment.</p>

<p>Now, permit me, as briefly as possible, to designate the cause of the
relationship between, and the interchangeableness of, religious feeling
and sexual desire, which, as I believe, is to be found in the once
widespread existence of phallic worship.</p>

<p>Some ten or twelve years ago, in an article on Suicide, which was
published in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>American Practitioner and News</i>, I suggested (as a possible explanation
for certain psychical phenomena) the existence in man of two
consciousnesses, an active, vigilant consciousness and a pseudo-dormant
consciousness. Again, in the <i>American Naturalist</i>, in an essay entitled
&ldquo;The Psychology of Hypnotism,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_100_133" id="FNanchor_100_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_133" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
I reasserted this theory and, to a certain extent, elaborated it. I
placed man&rsquo;s active consciousness in the cortical portion of the
brain, and his pseudo-dormant, <i>unconscious</i> consciousness (arbitrarily,
be it confessed) in the basilar ganglia, and called this latter
consciousness, &ldquo;ganglionic consciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recently, much has been written on the doctrine of duplex personality,
notably by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, in a series of papers read before the
Society of Psychical Research. Professor Newbold has also written very
entertainingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and instructively on this subject. While not fully accepting the theory
of &ldquo;duplex personality,&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i>, active consciousness and
<i>subliminal consciousness</i> (Myers&rsquo; name for the pseudo-dormant
consciousness), as having been proven, Newbold says: &ldquo;Of all the
theories developed from the point of independence, Mr. Myers&rsquo; is
the most comprehensive in its scope, is kept in most constant touch with
what the author regards as facts, and displays the greatest philosophic
insight.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_101_134" id="FNanchor_101_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_134" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
According to the theory of duplex personality, many instincts, desires,
and emotions have been crowded out of the active consciousness and have
been relegated to the pseudo-dormant consciousness. This has been
brought about by a &ldquo;process of selection out of an infinity of
possible elements solely on the grounds of utility.&rdquo; Thus the
<i>cause</i> for our horror of incest is hidden away in our subliminal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
consciousness; yet we cannot but think, with Westermarck, that this
instinct is but the result of natural selection,<a name="FNanchor_102_135" id="FNanchor_102_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_135" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
the utility of the factor or factors occasioning it being no longer in
evidence or required. Again, at certain seasons, man is seized with
<i>waldliebe</i> (forest-love) and longs to flee from the haunts of men, and,
with gun and rod, to revert, as far as possible, to the state of his
savage ancestors. The desire is safely hidden away in his subliminal
consciousness until favoring circumstances tempt it forth. It is not
alone in &ldquo;sleep, dreams, hypnosis, trance, and ecstacy that we see
a temporary subsidence of the upper consciousness and the upheaval of a
subliminal stratum&rdquo;; there are many other states and many other
causes for this strange psychical phenomenon.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated in the preceding pages that the worship of the
generative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
principle was almost, if not wholly, universal; I have also shown that
the beliefs, rites, and ceremonies of this cult made a lasting
impression upon the minds of every people among whom it gained a
foothold. Take the case of the ancient Hebrews. Notwithstanding the fact
that they were tried in the furnace of Javeh&rsquo;s awful wrath time
and again; notwithstanding the fact that famine, pestilence, war, and
imprisonment destroyed them by thousands; and, notwithstanding the fact
that they were threatened with utter and absolute annihilation&mdash;all
on account of this cult&mdash;they would not wholly abandon it. The
words of the prophets become almost pathetic as we read, over and over
again, that, although the kings did that which was pleasing in the sight
of the Lord, &ldquo;the high places and the groves were not
destroyed.&rdquo; Take the case of the Aztecs. Crushed beneath the iron
heels of Spain&rsquo;s hardy buccaneers, an utterly broken and conquered
race, Cortez<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
turned them over to the ministering care of his zealous priests. The
prison, agonizing torture, and the awful stake succeeded, at last, in
Christianizing them; they became children of Holy Mother Church! And
yet, hundreds of years after this &ldquo;glorious victory of the
cross,&rdquo; Biart finds the humble offerings of their descendants at
the feet of Mictlanteuctli! The modern Christian Indian, in the deep
shadows of the night, steals forth to offer up in secrecy a prayer at
the feet of one of the phallic trinity! What matters it to the modern
Aztec that his petition is offered to the ruler of Mictlan, the hell of
his forefathers, instead of to the mighty Ipalnemoani, the Life-Giver?<a name="FNanchor_103_136" id="FNanchor_103_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_136" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
In his opinion, Mictlanteuctli represents the entire Aztec theogony, for
has not his white priest kept the name of <i>this</i> god green in his
memory? All the other gods have been forgotten; their
personalities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
have been absorbed into that of the god of hell, for he has had
advertisers in the shape of Catholic priests ever since the fall of the
Aztec Empire! Take the case of the Peruvians. Although the Place of Gold
and the beautiful Virgins of the Sun are not even memories to the
descendants of the Incas, the religion which gave rise to them is not
wholly forgotten; &ldquo;phallic rites and ceremonies are to be observed
interwoven with their Christian ritual and belief!&rdquo; Take the case
of the Roman Catholic devotees of Isernia, of Varailles, of Lyons, of
hundreds of other places during the latter half of the eighteenth
century. Priapus died when the first Christian emperor took his seat on
the throne of Imperial Rome, and yet, hundreds and hundreds of years
thereafter, we behold some of the mysteries of Eleusis almost within the
shadow of St. Peter&rsquo;s!</p>

<p>Now, why is this? There can be but one answer, and that is that these
people simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
inherited a portion of the <i>psychos</i> of their forefathers, which made
the tenets of this religion natural and easy of belief. I have
demonstrated, I believe, that religious feeling was not a psychical
trait in the beginning; like a number of other mental attributes, it was
the result of evolution.<a name="FNanchor_104_137" id="FNanchor_104_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_137" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Mental abstraction, especially as associated with religious feeling, was
the result of psychical growth, of psychically inherited experiences.<a name="FNanchor_AH_138" id="FNanchor_AH_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_138" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a>
As <i>psychos</i> grew beneath the fostering influence of ages of experience,
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
mind became able to formulate abstract thought. In the beginning, the
process of ratiocination was, necessarily, very simple; but, simple as
it was, it was able to recognize the source of life&mdash;first, in the
sun, then, in the second place, in man himself; and, finally and
<i>abstractly</i>, in a source outside of, but connected with, man. This
abstract source, which sprung from sexuality, <i>ab initio</i>, they deified
and worshiped. Thus we see that, in the very beginning, the worship of
the generative principle sprung from, and was a part of, man himself.
Throughout thousands and thousands of years, religious feeling and
sexual desire, the component parts of phallic adoration, were intimately
associated; finally, religio-sexuality became an instinct, just as a
belief in the existence of a double or soul became an instinct.</p>

<p>Belief in the existence of a soul has never been repressed; its utility
is still recognized; hence, it is present in our active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
consciousness. The accumulated experiences of civilization have,
however, declared the inutility of phallic worship, hence, it has been
crowded out of our active consciousness by a process of selection and
has been relegated to the innermost recesses of our subliminal
consciousness, where also dwell many other formerly active instincts of
our savage ancestors. When circumstances favoring their appearances
occur, these pseudo-dormant instincts always become evident; it is due
to this fact that the correlation of religious emotion and sexual desire
exists.</p>

<h2><a name="VIRAGINITY_AND_EFFEMINATION" id="VIRAGINITY_AND_EFFEMINATION"></a>VIRAGINITY AND EFFEMINATION.</h2>

<p>In following up the chain of evolution in animal life from its inception
in primordial protoplasm to its end, as we now find it, we discover that
the interlinking organisms are, in the beginning, either asexual or
hermaphroditic. The moneron, the lowest form of animal life, simply
multiplies by division. The different elements through which propagation
and generation are carried on, are undoubtedly present even in the
moneron, but are not differentiated. The moneron is an organless,
structureless organism, consequently asexual. The cell, on the contrary,
is hermaphroditic, for it contains within itself the necessary elements
for reproducing itself. The am&oelig;ba is the connecting link which
connects all terrene life with primitive bathybian protoplasm, and is,
strictly speaking, a true hermaphrodite. Ascending at once to the sixth
stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in the ancestry of man, we come to the <i>acoelomi</i>, or worms without body
cavity. These worms are phylogenetic, consequently hermaphroditic. I do
not mean to say that these worms have the organs of each sex equally
developed; therefore, in the use of the word hermaphrodite, I use it in
its broadest sense. I simply mean that they are autogenetic. In the
<i>rhabdocoela</i> the sexual organs appear in their simplest forms&mdash;a
testis anterior to a single or double ovary. Other gliding worms have a
more complex arrangement of the sexual organs, but most of them are true
hermaphrodites. Next in the chain of evolutionary development, and one
step nearer man, we find the soft worms (<i>scolecidae</i>); from a branch of
this family the parent group of vertebrates was developed. The immediate
ancestor of the vertebrates was either the amphioxus (lancelet) or some
other notochordate animal, whose type is now extinct. Thus we have
traced hermaphroditism from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
am&oelig;ba to the amphioxus, from the ancestor of the parent cell to the
ancestor of the vertebrates. We could carry it further, but it is
unnecessary. Effemination and viraginity, are due directly to the
influence of that strange law laid down by Darwin&mdash;the law of
reversion to ancestral types. It is an effort of nature to return man to
the old hermaphroditic form from which he was evolved. It is an effort
on the part of nature to incorporate the individualities of the male and
female, both physical and psychical, in one body. The phenomenon of
atavism is more apt to occur in feeble types than in strong, healthy and
well-developed types. Microcephalism, occurring, as it most frequently
does, among ignorant, ill-nourished, and unhealthy people, is an
example. Dolichocephalism and a flattening of the cranial arch, with
corresponding loss of capacity in the skull&mdash;types that we see
everywhere among the depraved and vicious&mdash;are other examples of
this tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of atavism to seize on weakened and unhealthy subjects. Effemination
finds more victims among the wealthy and the educated than among the
poor and uneducated. This phenomenon is a psychic rather than a physical
hermaphroditism, and is directly traceable to the enervation produced by
the habits of the wealthy and unemployed. Wealth begets luxury, luxury
begets debauchery and consequent enervation. Periods of moral decadence
in the life of a nation are always coincident with periods of luxury and
great wealth, with consequent enervation and effemination; examples of
this may be found in the histories of Rome, Greece, and France. During
the reign of Louis XV., examples of effemination crowded into the court
and vied with the royal fop in the splendor of their raiment and
effeminacy of their bearing. Psychic hermaphroditism does not occur
<i>naturally</i> in uncivilized or half-civilized races. The reason for this
is patent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Atavism finds among them no weakened and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'enverated'.">enervated</ins>
subjects on whom to perpetrate this strange travesty on nature.</p>

<p>Large cities are the hotbeds and breeding-places of the various
neuroses. There general paresis treads closely upon the heels of sexual
neurasthenia, while the victims of hysteria and kindred ills are almost
countless in their number. What wonder, then, that the offspring of such
parents should be weak and neurasthenic, and fall easy victims to the
thousand and one erotic fancies which beset them! What wonder that here
atavism finds its richest field, and plays its strangest and most
fearful pranks, sending men into the world with the tastes, desires, and
habits of women, and women with all the mental hibitudes of men! Juvenal
wrote in scathing, searing sarcasm of the degeneracy of the Roman youth;
effemination was very prevalent, and this bitter satirist wrote burning
words against their degrading and bestial practices. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
seems to me that we are beginning to need a Juvenal for this day and
generation!</p>

<p>People divide themselves into classes, and these classes are generally
exceedingly clannish. It is not <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'considerd'.">considered</ins>
&ldquo;good form&rdquo; to marry out of the class to which an individual
may belong, consequently, no new types of individuals are added. Luxury
and debauchery enervate the classes which indulge in them. The people of
these classes intermarry among themselves, no new blood is added, hence,
in a very few generations, degeneration sets in.</p>

<p>Effemination and viraginity are common types of degeneration which
always follow in the wake of luxury and debauchery. Effemination makes
its appearance early in life. The young boy likes the society of girls;
he plays with dolls, and, if permitted, will don female attire and dress
his hair like a girl. He learns to sew, to knit, to embroider, to do
&ldquo;tatting.&rdquo; He becomes a connoisseur in female dress, and
likes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
discuss matters pertaining to the toilet of females. He does not care
for boyish sports, and when he grows older, takes no pleasure in the
amusements and pursuits of his masculine acquaintances. He prefers to
spend his time with women and to engage in their employments and
amusements. As the change in his psychic being becomes more pronounced
and more overpowering, he will endeavor to approach the female in gait,
attitude, and style of dress.</p>

<p>I have seen mothers guilty of incalculable harm by fostering such
inclinations in their sons. They think (the thought is a natural one)
that such perversions of taste indicate gentleness and kindliness, and
induce their sons to continue in the practice of them, thus assisting
atavism in its baneful work.</p>

<p>Effemination is a disease which, taken at its inception, can generally
be eradicated and cured. As soon as it is discovered, the boy&rsquo;s
surroundings should be changed; his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mind should be directed into new channels, and his dormant boy&rsquo;s
nature aroused. Outdoor exercise and a free intercourse with companions
of his own sex should be made important factors in the treatment of an
incipient effeminant. He should be carefully watched until <i>vita
sexualis</i> has been established; he should then be taught the dangers of
youthful follies and indiscretions.</p>

<p>A dandified man is always ridiculous, but when he adds to his foppery,
effemination, he then becomes contemptible.</p>

<p>Several years ago I had the opportunity of studying a pronounced
effeminant. He is one of the best known young men of a Southern city,
and is a leader in society. He took me to his &ldquo;boudoir&rdquo; and
showed me his &ldquo;lingerie.&rdquo; The words quoted are his own. His
nightgowns were marvels of artistic needlework, as far as I was able to
judge, and were made by himself. His nightcaps were &ldquo;sweetly
pretty,&rdquo; and one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
them was a &ldquo;perfect dream of beauty.&rdquo; On his dressing-table
were all the accessories of a modern society woman&rsquo;s toilet,
including rouge, powder, a complete manicure set, and numerous bottles
of perfumes and toilet waters. In his wardrobe he had displayed on
forms, some six or eight corsets and chemisettes&mdash;&ldquo;corset-covers,&rdquo; as he designated them.</p>

<p>This man&rsquo;s voice and manner of speaking are decidedly feminine;
all the little mannerisms and affectations of a society woman being
faithfully reproduced. I understand from his associates that he is a
splendid business man, and that not a breath of scandal has ever
tarnished his good name. He was reared by his mother, and never
associated with boys until his sixteenth year. I understood from him
that she always treated him as a girl, and consulted him in all things
pertaining to her toilet. He seemed utterly unconscious of his anomalous
condition, and as his business associates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
are gentlemen, and his intimate friends are ladies, he may drift through
life without a single jar to mar the serenity of his existence.</p>

<p>Viraginity is, comparatively, an infrequent occurrence, but under its
influence the unfortunate victims are guilty of startling vagaries. The
recent case of Alice Mitchell, who killed Miss Ward, at Memphis, Tenn.,
is an example of pronounced viraginity. We see daily in the newspapers
accounts of women who masquerade as men, and history abounds in like
instances. The celebrated writer Count Sandor V. was a woman who posed
as a man, and who was in fact Sarolta (Charlotte), Countess V.
&ldquo;Among many foolish things that her father encouraged in her was
the fact that he brought her up as a boy, called her Sandor, allowed her
to ride, drive, and hunt, admiring her muscular energy.&rdquo; At the
age of thirteen she ran away from school, where she had been sent by her
mother, and returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
home. &ldquo;Sarolta returned to her mother, who, however, could do
nothing and was compelled to allow her daughter to again become Sandor,
wear male clothes, and, at least once a year, to fall in love with
persons of her own sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mothers, early in life, though not from any sense of danger to their
daughters, begin to eradicate the tom-boy inclinations in their female
children; hence the comparative infrequency of viraginity. The
congenital viragint will always remain somewhat masculine in her tastes
and ideas, but her inclinations and desires having been turned toward
femininity early in life, she will escape the horrors of complete
viraginity or gynandry. The victim of effemination, however, is saved by
no such accidental forethought. The ignorant mother fosters feminine
inclinations and desires in her effeminate son until his psychic being
becomes entirely changed, and not even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
establishment of <i>vita sexualis</i> will save him from effemination.</p>

<p>An only son, who is in the least degree neurasthenic, runs the risk of
becoming an effeminant under the tutelage of a loving but ignorant
mother who encourages his feminine tastes and inclinations. A young man
of my acquaintance, who is an only son, is so situated. This young man
devotes his entire attention to matters of the toilet. He paints his
cheeks and powders his face; even his eyebrows and eyelashes are
anointed with some dark-colored ointment or pomade.</p>

<p>Effemination and viraginity are more prevalent in the Old World than in
the United States. The civilization and settlement of the United States
are, comparatively speaking, new. The people are, as yet, a young,
strong, and vigorous nation. Years of luxury and debauchery have not yet
brought the penalty of enervation and neurasthenia to the <i>masses</i>,
though in certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
circles of society, it is becoming painfully evident that that penalty
is being even now exacted.</p>

<p>In this article I have described only mild types of viraginity and
effemination. In the more pronounced types of these singular examples of
atavism or reversion, the victims commit the most unheard of and the
most unnatural acts.</p>

<p>Almost every case of effemination or viraginity can be cured if
recognized and treated in its incipiency. The parents should be the
physicians. They should keep a watchful supervision over their
offspring, and as soon as any evidences of effemination or viraginity
become apparent, treatment, both physical and psychical, should at once
be instituted.</p>

<p>Effemination has occasioned the downfall of many nations; let us guard
against it with all our power. Let us train up our boys to be manly men,
and our girls to be womanly women.</p>

<h2><a name="BORDERLANDS_AND_CRANKDOM" id="BORDERLANDS_AND_CRANKDOM"></a>BORDERLANDS AND CRANKDOM.</h2>

<p>When that bilious critic and merciless crucifier of human foibles,
Carlyle, himself a degenerate, wrote that nine-tenths of the world were
fools, he was much nearer truth than most men think. When we take an
introspective view of our sane personality, we shudder to see how near
it is to the borderlands of insanity and the bizarre and eccentric world
of crankdom. There hardly lives a man who does not possess some
eccentricity, or who does not cherish, hidden, perhaps, deep within
himself, some small delusion, which he is ashamed to acknowledge to the
outside world. Social relations and the iron rules of custom hold in
place the balance-wheel of many a disordered mind. The mental equipoise
is kept at the normal standard only by the powerful aid of the will,
supported and assisted by extraneous adjuvants, such as fear of
punishment, fear of personal harm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and, above all, by the fear of ridicule. Many a man hugs his delusions
closely to his heart, indulges them only in the secret recesses of his
soul, and, their sole owner and acquaintance, carries them with him to
his grave.</p>

<p>Any man who has a retentive memory, and one capable of minute analysis,
can look back in his life and recall moments when his insane personality
got the better of his will, and ran riot in forbidden pathways. He may
not have committed an insane act; yet the thought, the impulse, the
delusion was there and only outside influences kept it from breaking
forth. Who fails to remember certain times in his life when he has had
an almost overpowering desire to cry out in church, or to laugh on some
sad or solemn occasion; or, having a razor in his hand, has had an
impulse, sudden and intense, to draw it across his throat; or, being on
some high place, has been seized with the desire to hurl himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
downward? This shows how near indeed the healthy mind ever hovers on the
borderlands of insanity.</p>

<p>Man stands so close to the portals of insanity that he can look through
the gateway, when he takes an introspective view of his psychical being,
and can see the phantoms and mental ghosts of his insane personality.</p>

<p>We have every reason to believe that, among civilized races, there is a
vast amount of latent insanity. Taking the tables of our insane asylums,
we find a thousand and one causes given as the exciting factors in the
mental overthrow. Love, religion, anger, disappointment, etc., down
through the long list of psychic and &aelig;sthetic emotions, until it seems
as though even a breath of wind would be sufficient to destroy the
mental equipoise.</p>

<p>Among savage and uncivilized races, insanity is of infrequent
occurrence. Only when a race begins to elevate itself and take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on a higher view of morality, when new rules and new laws, new customs
and innovations, tending to place individuals in a state of comparison,
arise, does insanity make its appearance. The untutored savage, living
in a state of communism, is untroubled by the jealousies and
heart-burnings of his civilized congener. He lives in the to-day and
allows the to-morrow to take care of itself. Devoid of ambition, a mere
animal, sensual and indolent, he cares only for the gratification of his
physical desires. The mental attributes of a civilized being are, in
him, wanting.</p>

<p>Psychos is the result of evolutionary development, and the chief reason
why insanity is not as prevalent in the savage as in the civilized man,
is because the brain of the savage lacks development. I do not wish to
convey the idea that insanity is purely psychical in its nature.
Insanity is the result of a material change in the structure of the
brain produced by morbific action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The manifestations of insanity are merely the symptoms of a disease that
involves the brain. The savage has less development of psychical
function, consequently he is less liable to mental lesion. I mean by
psychical function that portion of the brain in which psychos has its
origin. Alienists consider the habits of men as being the factor in the
production of insanity. Habits and heredity are undoubted factors in the
production of diseased minds, and, in fact, are the chief agents. You
cannot, however, expect to find a disordered function where that
function is absent. Savages have paresis, apoplexy, and imbecility,
seldom or never insanity. The reason is patent&mdash;they lack the
psychic function, that peculiar element, whatever it may be, which
raises civilized man so high above them. That this element can be
developed in savages I do not for one instant deny. The ploughshare of
evolutionary civilization will bring it to the surface sooner or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
later, and when it does insanity follows. I have only to point to the
American negro to prove the truth of my proposition; even he is
partially exempt, simply because his civilization is of such recent date
that his brain has not yet acquired its full quota of the psychic
element.</p>

<p>I will venture to assert, so true is the fact that insanity is the
product of civilization, that, if it were not for the combating
influences of social laws, assisted not a little by scientific medical
aid, all North America could not contain the vast and enormous army that
would constitute the civilized world&rsquo;s array of lunatics.</p>

<p>There seems to be in the minds of men an instinctive awe of anything
that appertains to the insane. In olden times a disordered mind was
considered of divine or diabolic origin as it evinced good or evil
tendencies. This belief lasted even until the present century. Many old
women who were the victims of senile dementia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and kindred ills, were accused of witchcraft and intercourse with the
devil, here in the United States, not a century ago. Witches were
executed in England and men burned at the stake in Spain, not two
hundred years ago, for the crime of demoniacal possession. Even in this
enlightened age men are accustomed to consider insanity rather from its
psychical standpoint than from its physical aspect. They do not take
into consideration the fact that insanity is due to a physical lesion,
and that its vagaries are but the symptoms of brain disease or brain
deformity. The inhabitants of the borderlands are invested with a
certain shadowy mystery which separates them from the rest of mankind,
and which makes them appear to us as denizens of another psychical world
than ours.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, cranks, whose eccentricities took a religious turn,
were considered holy. St. Simon Stylites was a very pronounced crank,
and a very holy man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
also, because he chose to live the greater portion of his life perched
on a pillar seventy feet high. St. Anthony was another holy crank who
never, in all his life, washed his feet. Poor Joan of Arc was burned at
the stake because she was &ldquo;possessed of a false and lying
devil.&rdquo; She has been recently proposed for canonization by the
same church that burned her, and thus, in a measure, had justice done
her. I do not think, however, that this is any recompense for the
terrible agony inflicted on this unfortunate victim of hystero-epilepsy.</p>

<p>Says Maudsley in &ldquo;Responsibility in Mental Disease&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Some of the prophets of the Old Testament presented symptoms
which can hardly be interpreted as other than the effects of madness;
certainly if they were not mad, they imitated very closely some of its
most striking features.&rdquo; Jeremiah takes a long journey to the
river Euphrates and hides a linen girdle in a hole of a rock. He then
returns home and in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
few days makes the same journey, and finds the girdle rotten and good
for nothing. Ezekiel digs a hole in the wall of his house, and through
it removes his household goods, instead of through the door. Hosea
marries a prostitute because he said he had been commanded by God so to
do. Isaiah stripped himself naked and paraded up and down in sight of
all the people.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest changes in the world&rsquo;s history have been
effected by dwellers in the borderlands. Mahomet was an epileptic, and
his first vision was the result on an epileptic convulsion or seizure.
The character of his visions was exactly like that of those visions
which an epileptic sees and describes at the present time. Mahomet
believed in his visions, and, what is more, got more than half the world
to believe in them also. Gautama was a dweller in the borderlands, yet
his followers now number five hundred millions.</p>

<p>The novel mode in which an insane man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
regards things may be an inspiration which reflection could never
attain, and it sometimes happens that opinions which seem to the world
to be the ravings of a madman, have turned out to be true. The insane
man has the world against him, and though he may pose for a short time
as a reformer, sooner or later lands in the asylum.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the crank will succeed in getting converts. A
notable instance is Schweinfurth, or &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; as he
calls himself. I am firmly convinced that this man believes in his
delusions. One thing is certain, and that is, his disciples believe in
him implicitly. This man is dangerous to society, inasmuch as he has
caused the separation of several wives from their husbands; the wives
abandoning their husbands to follow him to &ldquo;Heaven,&rdquo; as he
calls his farm house.</p>

<p>The crank is, generally, a harmless individual, and is not anti-social
unless his delusions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
take the form of homicidal impulse, pyromania, kleptomania, etc.</p>

<p>Homicidal impulse is the most dangerous to society of the many mental
vagaries and derangements which afflict the dwellers in the borderlands.
Its invasion is sudden and its impulse is, generally, overpowering. A
man may be walking the streets presumably in perfect health, and yet
have, all the while, a voice whispering in his ear &ldquo;kill,
kill.&rdquo; His insane desire at length reaches its acme, and he throws
aside every mental restraint and kills the first individual he may
chance to meet. Again, he may desire to kill some particular individual,
and will carefully and systematically arrange his plans for the
successful enactment of the homicide. The murderers of Garfield and
Harrison probably belong to this latter class, though in the case of
Prendergast, the slayer of Mayor Harrison, this opinion may be
erroneous. There is something about his photograph that leads me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to believe that he is a moral imbecile, rather than an intellectual
dyscrasiac.</p>

<p>A clerk in a solicitor&rsquo;s office, at Alton, Hampshire, England, one
afternoon took a walk outside the town, when he met some children. He
persuaded one of these, a girl of nine, to go with him into a
neighboring garden. A short while after, he was seen walking quietly
home; he was seen to wash himself in the river and then go back to his
office. The little girl did not return home, and, search having been
instituted, her dismembered body was found strewn about the garden. The
clerk was arrested, and in his diary was found this entry, recently
made: &ldquo;Killed a little girl; it was fine and hot.&rdquo; This man
was either a sadistic sexual pervert, or a victim of homicidal impulse.
Maudsley gives this instance as an example of the latter, while <ins
class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read
'Kraft-Ebing'.">Krafft-Ebing</ins> gives it as an example of the former. There
is a great difference between these two mental derangements. The victim
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
homicidal impulse kills without any ulterior object, while the sadist
kills in order to gratify his unnatural and perverted sexual appetite.</p>

<p>The victim of homicidal impulse is, to all outward appearances,
perfectly sane otherwise. His impulse frequently leaves him for years
and then returns with overpowering force.</p>

<p>Epileptics who have just passed through violent convulsions, will
frequently attack bystanders with great fury. Some alienists declare
that homicidal mania is frequently only a masked epilepsy. All
epileptics should be carefully watched; they may become dangerous to
society at any moment. Numerous instances are recorded of murder
committed by sufferers from <i>petit mal</i>, a form of epilepsy. I once saw
a negro walk up to a white man, who was a stranger and unknown by him,
and fell him to the earth by striking him with a club. The negro was
arrested, and the next day swore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that he was entirely unconscious of having struck anyone. It was proven
at his trial that he was subject to mild epileptic attacks.</p>

<p>I believe that all suicides are due to mental aberration. It may be the
result of a momentary and sudden loss of mental equipoise, or the final
and fatal ending of a premeditated desire carried through days, weeks,
months, and even years.</p>

<p>We see a man, blessed with everything that makes life enjoyable, genial,
gay, with a ready smile and kindly word for everyone, suddenly, in a
moment, pass forever out into the unknown&mdash;self-killed, a victim of his
own creation. We stand amazed! Why did he do it? We can find nothing in
his past or present condition to warrant such an action.</p>

<p>He was the victim of momentary aberration, or, perhaps, deep in his
mind, buried and hidden even from himself, there dwelt a desire for
self-slaughter, when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
&ldquo;physical pain, an unexpected impression, a moral affection, an
indiscreet proposition&rdquo; uncovered this desire, and he at once
committed the deed!</p>

<p>There are epidemics of suicide. Let the papers chronicle some peculiar
method of suicide selected by some unfortunate, and others will
immediately follow his example. Unconscious cerebration also hurls many
souls out of the world. I was called to see a gentleman who had
attempted suicide by slashing the radial artery at the wrist. I found
him holding a compress on the severed vessel and greatly alarmed. He
swore to me that he was totally unconscious how he had come to do the
deed, and that he did not know that he had cut himself until he felt the
pain and saw the blood flowing from the wound!</p>

<p>Viraginity and effemination, while not mental insanities, strictly
speaking, are, nevertheless, mental deformities, and their unfortunate
victims are dwellers in the borderlands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Mild forms of these types of degeneration are very abundant. The
effeminate, cigarette-smoking, soda-drinking young man of the comic
weeklies, and the loud, horsy, slang-using, vulgar, masculine young
woman are seen everywhere.</p>

<p>Effemination and viraginity are the results of the weakening effects of
luxury and consequent debauchery. Nations, time and again, have felt the
dire effects of effemination and have sunk beneath them. The Grecian,
the Roman, the Egyptian nations are familiar examples. The satirists of
the golden age of the Latin people dipped their <i>stili</i>, metaphorically,
in gall and bitter wormwood and berated the effeminate nobility time and
again. One of them advised the Roman ladies to look for <i>men</i> among the
gladiators and the peasants! Anacreon&rsquo;s poems are filled with
allusions to effemination and the delights of psychic hermaphroditism.</p>

<p>In the time of Louis XIV., of France,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the royal palaces were filled to repletion with effeminants, who vied
with the women in the splendor of their robes and the salacious
eccentricities of their conduct. The case of Alice Mitchell, who killed
Freda Ward in Memphis not long ago, was one of pronounced viraginity.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for the good of the community at large, there are,
comparatively speaking, few viragints. The careful mother restrains,
tempers, and abolishes the hoydenish habits of her &ldquo;tom-boy&rdquo;
girl early in life, and turns her thoughts toward feminine pursuits and
desires. The unfortunate effeminant, however, is encouraged in his
feminine tastes and habits by his unwise mother, who likes her boy to
sit beside her and sew and knit, if he so desires. She discusses matters
of the toilet with him, and, in fact, treats him as she would a
daughter. In the end, his psychic hermaphroditism becomes complete, and
one more unfortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
goes out into the world to swell the ranks of crankdom!</p>

<p>Kleptomaniacs are greatly to be pitied, for they are generally women in
whom the moral sense is very much developed. The victim of kleptomania
will steal any and everything; they are like magpies in this respect. An
acquaintance of mine, a most estimable lady, a devout Christian, and a
most exemplary wife and mother, is the most incorrigible thief I ever
saw. She has often picked my pockets while I was engaged about her
sick-bed. The merchants of the city where she lives know her infirmity,
watch her while she is in their shops, and respectfully and kindly
relieve her of her pilferings when she starts to leave. She expresses
great sorrow for her unfortunate insane impulse, and has often begged
her husband to have her placed in an asylum. This he refuses to do, as
she is perfectly sane otherwise. The husband was called away for several
weeks, and, on his return,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
took me to his house and showed me her room. In the room were the
objects stolen during his absence. It was the most miscellaneous
collection of valuables and trash I ever saw. She had gathered together
everything from a darning-needle to a tombstone, a small specimen of the
latter forming a unit of this heterogeneous whole. This form of mental
dyscrasia is much more frequent than people suppose, and the antecedents
of shop-lifters and the like should be carefully examined before a
judgment on their criminality is passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eccentricity is certainly not always insanity, but there can be
no question that it is often the outcome of insane temperament, and may
approach very near to, or actually pass into, insanity.&rdquo; Alienists
rely on the eccentric and peculiar changes which take place in the
characters of their patients, who either present themselves or are
brought to them for treatment, to establish their diagnosis. If a modest
and truthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
man suddenly becomes a braggart and a liar; or, if a humane man becomes
cruel, or a neat man slovenly, there is reason to suspect brain trouble.
The intellect may appear intact, so also the reasoning powers, but these
eccentricities indicate a deviation which may lead to mental
destruction. The last faculty to develop in the mind of man is the moral
faculty; this faculty is the one first lost by diseased brains. If a
man, who suddenly becomes dissolute and licentious (who, heretofore, has
led a virtuous, moral life), be examined, in nine cases in ten his brain
will be found to be diseased. The little cloud, which at first is no
larger than a man&rsquo;s hand, grows ever larger and larger, and in the
end overspreads the entire mental sky!</p>

<h2><a name="GENIUS_AND_DEGENERATION" id="GENIUS_AND_DEGENERATION"></a>GENIUS AND DEGENERATION.</h2>

<p>That the psychical function or intellectuality is frequently developed
at the expense of the physical organism is well known, and that genius
is seldom or never unaccompanied by physical and mental degeneration is
a fact that can be no longer denied. I use the word degeneration in its
broadest sense, and intend it to include all kinds of abnormalities. The
facts noted above are by no means recent knowledge, but were vaguely
recognized and commented on centuries and decades of centuries ago by
the Hebrews and kindred races of people. The Hebrew word <i>nabi</i> means
either madman or prophet, and it is now admitted that most of the
prophets gave evidences of insanity as well as genius. The Greeks and
the Romans recognized this kinship, and we read in the Bible of a
certain Festus, who, when confronted by a man of genius, and being
unable to answer his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
arguments, said to him, &ldquo;Paul, much learning hath made thee
mad!&rdquo; Lauvergne, when speaking of the oxycephalic (sugarloaf)
skull, an unquestionable example of degeneration, wrote many years ago,
&ldquo;This head announces the monstrous alliance of the most eminent
faculty of man, genius, with the most pronounced impulses to rape,
murder, and theft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to show that wherever genius is observed,
we find it accompanied by degeneration, which is evinced by physical
abnormalties or mental eccentricities. It is a strange fact, however,
and one not noticed by Lombroso, or any other writer, as far as I know,
that mechanical geniuses, or those who, for the most part, deal with
material facts, do not, as a rule, show any signs of degeneration. I
have only to instance Darwin, Galileo, Edison, Watts, Rumsey, Howe, and
Morse to prove the truth of this assertion. It is only the genius of
&aelig;stheticism, the genius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of the emotion, that is generally accompanied by unmistakable signs of
degeneration.</p>

<p>Saul, the first king of Israel, was a man of genius and, at times, a
madman. We read that, before his coronation, he was seized with an
attack of madness and joined a company of kindred eccentrics. His
friends and acquaintances were naturally surprised and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Is Saul among the prophets?&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i>, &ldquo;Has Saul
become insane?&rdquo; Again, we are told that he was suddenly seized
with an attack of homicidal impulse, and tried to kill David. Before
this time he had had repeated attacks of madness, which only the harp of
David could control and subdue. David himself was a man whose mental
equilibrium was not well established, as his history clearly indicates.
He forsook his God, indulged in licentious practices, and was, withal, a
very, immoral man at times. At his time, the Hebrews had reached a high
degree of civilization.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Abstract ethics had become very much developed, and any example of great
immorality occurring during this epoch is proof positive of atavism or
degeneration.</p>

<p>As I have intimated before, many of the ancient Hebrew prophets, who
were unquestionably men of genius, gave evidences of insanity; notably
Jeremiah, who made a long journey to the River Euphrates, where he hid a
linen girdle. He returned home, and in a few days made the same journey
and found the girdle rotten and good for nothing; Ezekiel, who dug a
hole in the wall of his house, through which he removed his household
goods, instead of through the door; Hosea, who married a prostitute,
because God, so he declared, had told him so to do; and Isaiah, who
stripped himself naked and paraded up and down in sight of all the
people. King Solomon, a man of pre-eminent genius, was mentally
unbalanced. The &ldquo;Song of Solomon&rdquo; shows very clearly that he
was a victim of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
psychical disorder, sexual in its character and origin. The poems of
Anacreon are lascivious, lustful, and essentially carnal, and history
informs us that he was a sexual pervert.</p>

<p>Swinburne&rsquo;s poems show clearly the mental bias of their author,
who is described as being peculiar and eccentric. Many of the men of
genius who have assisted in making the history of the world have been
the victims of epilepsy. Julius C&aelig;sar, military leader, statesman,
politician, and author, was an epileptic. Twice on the field of battle
he was stricken down by this disorder. On one occasion, while seated at
the tribune, he was unable to rise when the senators, consuls, and
pr&aelig;tors paid him a visit of ceremony and honor. They were offended at
his seeming lack of respect, and retired, showing signs of anger. C&aelig;sar
returned home, stripped off his clothes, and offered his throat to be
cut by anyone. He then explained his conduct to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the senate, saying that he was the victim of a malady which, at times,
rendered him incapable of standing. During the attacks of this disorder
&ldquo;he felt shocks in his limbs, became giddy, and at last lost
consciousness.&rdquo; Moli&egrave;re was the victim of epilepsy; so also
was Petrarch, Flaubert, Charles V., Handel, St. Paul, Peter the Great,
and Dostoieffsky; Paganini, Mozart, Schiller, Alfieri, Pascal,
Richelieu, Newton, and Swift were the victims of diseases epileptoid in
character.</p>

<p>Many men of genius have suffered from spasmodic and choreic movements,
notably Lenau, Montesquieu, Buffon, Dr. Johnson, Santeuil, Cr&eacute;billon,
Lombardini, Thomas Campbell, Carducci, Napoleon, and Socrates.</p>

<p>Suicide, essentially a symptom of mental disorder, has hurried many a
man of genius out into the unknown. The list begins with such eminent
men as Zeno, Cleanthes, Dionysius, Lucan, and Stilpo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and contains the names of such immortals as Chatterton, Blount, Haydon,
Clive, and David.</p>

<p>Alcoholism and morphinism, or an uncontrollable desire for alcohol or
opium in some form or other, are now recognized as evidences of
degeneration. Men of genius, both in the Old World and in the New, have
shown this form of degeneration. Says Lombroso: &ldquo;Alexander died
after having emptied ten times the goblet of Hercules, and it was,
without doubt, in an alcoholic attack, while pursuing naked the infamous
Thais, that he killed his dearest friend. C&aelig;sar was often carried home
intoxicated on the shoulders of his soldiers. Neither Socrates, nor
Seneca, nor Alcibiades, nor Cato, nor Peter the Great (nor his wife
Catherine, nor his daughter Elizabeth) were remarkable for their
abstinence. One recalls Horace&rsquo;s line, &lsquo;<i>Narratur et prisci
Cantonis s&aelig;pe mero caluisse virtus.</i>&rsquo; Tiberius Nero was called by
the Romans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Biberius Mero. Septimius Severus and Mahomet II. succumbed to
drunkenness or <i>delirium tremens</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the men and women of genius of the Old World who abused the use of
alcohol and opium, were Coleridge, James Thomson, Carew, Sheridan,
Steele, Addison, Hoffman, Charles Lamb, Madame de Sta&euml;l, Burns, Savage,
Alfred de Musset, Kleist, Caracci, Jan Steen, Morland Turner (the
painter), G&eacute;rard de Nerval, Hartley Coleridge, Dussek, Handel, Gl&uuml;ck,
Praga, Rovani, and the poet Somerville. This list is by no means
complete, as the well-informed reader may see at a glance; it serves to
show, however, how very often this form of degeneration makes its
appearance in men of genius.</p>

<p>In men of genius the moral sense is sometimes obtunded, if not
altogether absent. Sallust, Seneca, and Bacon were suspected felons.
Rousseau, Byron, Foscolo, and Caresa were grossly immoral, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Casanova, the gifted mathematician, was a common swindler. Murat,
Rousseau, Clement, Diderot, Praga, and Oscar Wilde were sexual perverts.</p>

<p>Genius, like insanity, lives in a world of its own, hence we find few,
if any, evidences of human affection in men of genius. Says Lombroso:
&ldquo;I have been able to observe men of genius when they had scarce
reached the age of puberty; they did not manifest the deep aversions of
moral insanity, but I have noticed among all a strange apathy for
everything which does not concern them; as though, plunged in the
hypnotic condition, they did not perceive the troubles of others, or
even the most pressing needs of those who were dearest to them; if they
observed them, they grew tender, at once hastening to attend them; but
it was a fire of straw, soon extinguished, and it gave place to
indifference and weariness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This emotional an&aelig;sthesia is indicative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of psychical atavism, and is an unmistakable evidence of degeneration.
Lombroso gives a long list of the men of genius who were celibates. I
will mention a few of those with whom the English-speaking world is most
familiar: Kant, Newton, Pitt, Fox, Beethoven, Galileo, Descartes, Locke,
Spinoza, Leibnitz, Gray, Dalton, Hume, Gibbon, Macaulay, Lamb, Bentham,
Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Reynolds, Handel, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer,
Schopenhauer, Camo&euml;ns, and Voltaire. La Bruy&egrave;re says of men
of genius: &ldquo;These men have neither ancestors nor descendants; they
themselves form their entire posterity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a form of mental obliquity which the French term <i>folie du
doute</i>. It is characterized by an incertitude in thought co&ouml;rdination,
and often leads its victims into the perpetration of nonsensical and
useless acts. Men of genius are very frequently afflicted with this form
of mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
disorder. Dr. Johnson, who was a sufferer from <i>folie du doute</i>, had to
touch every post he passed. If he missed one he had to retrace his steps
and touch it. Again, if he started out of a door on the wrong foot he
would return and make another attempt, starting out on the foot which he
considered the correct one to use. Napoleon counted and added up the
rows of windows in every street through which he passed. A celebrated
statesman, who is a personal friend of the writer, can never bear to
place his feet on a crack in the pavement or floor. When walking he will
carefully step over and beyond all cracks or crevices. This idiosyncracy
annoys him greatly, but the impulse is imperative, and he can not resist
it.</p>

<p>Those who have been intimately associated with men of genius have
noticed that they are very frequently amnesic or
&ldquo;absent-minded.&rdquo; Newton once tried to stuff his
niece&rsquo;s finger into the bowl of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lighted pipe, and Rovelle would lecture on some subject for hours at a
time and then conclude by saying: &ldquo;But this is one of my arcana,
which I tell to no one.&rdquo; One of his students would then whisper
what he had just said into his ear, and Rovelle would believe that his
pupil &ldquo;had discovered the arcanum by his own sagacity, and would
beg him not to divulge what he himself had just told to two hundred
persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lombroso has combed history, as it were, with a fine-tooth comb, and
very few geniuses have escaped his notice. This paper, so far, is hardly
more than a review of his extraordinarily comprehensive work; therefore,
I will conclude this portion of it with a list of men of genius, their
professions, and their evidences of degeneration, as gathered from his
book:</p>

<p>The reader will observe that I have made use of the comprehensive word,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
writer, to designate all kinds of literary work except theology and
philosophy. The above list is by no means complete, and only contains
the names of those geniuses with whom the world is well acquainted.</p>

<p>When we come to the geniuses of the New World, we find that, though few
in number, they, nevertheless, show erraticism and degeneration. Poe was
undoubtedly a man of great genius, and his degeneration was indicated by
his excessive use of alcohol. Aaron Burr was the victim of moral
an&aelig;sthesia, and Jefferson was pseudo-epileptic and neurasthenic.
Randolph was a man of marked eccentricity, and Benedict Arnold was,
morally, an&aelig;sthetic. Daniel Webster was addicted to an over-indulgence
in alcohol, likewise Thomas Marshall and the elder Booth. Booth also had
attacks of acute mania. His son Edwin had paresis; so also had John
McCullough, John T. Raymond, and Bartley Campbell. A distinguished
statesman and politician,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and a man who stands high in the councils of the nation, has, for a
number of years, given evidence of mental obliquity by his
uncontrollable desire for alcohol. No power, outside of bodily
restraint, can control him and keep him from indulging his appetite for
alcohol when this desire seizes him. One of the most noted poets of
to-day, whose verses stir the heart with their pathos and bring smiles
to the gravest countenances with their humor, was, for a number of years
(and still is, so I have been told), an inordinate user of alcohol.</p>

<p>Robert Ingersoll was undoubtedly a man of genius and of considerable
originality, and a close study of his writings shows conclusively his
mental eccentricity. Judging wholly from his printed utterances, Mr.
Ingersoll was only a superficial scientist and mediocre scholar. His
power lay in his wonderful word imagery, and his intricately constructed
verbal arabesques. He was a verbal symbolist. Symbolism, wherever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
found, and in whatever art, if carried to any extent, must necessarily
be an evidence of atavism, consequently of degeneration.</p>

<p>Thomas Paine gave evidences of a lack of mental equipoise. We find
scattered throughout his works the most brilliant, irrefutable, and
logical truths side by side with the most inane, illogical, and stolid
crudities. Among other men of genius who showed signs of degeneration we
may include Alexander Stevens, Joel Hart, Adams, Train, Breckenridge,
Webster, Blaine, Van Buren, Houston, Grant, Hawthorne, Bartholow, Walt
Whitman. We must not confound genius and talent&mdash;the two are widely
different. Genius is essentially original and spontaneous, while talent
is to some extent acquired. Genius is a <i>quasi</i> abnormality, and one for
which the world should be devoutly grateful. <i>Psychos</i>, in the case of
genius, is not uniformly developed, one part, being more favored than
the others, absorbs and uses more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
its share of that element, whatsoever it be, which goes to make up
intellectuality, hence the less favored or less acquisitive parts show
degeneration.</p>

<div class="blockquot i"><p>The greatest, best, and highest law of higher civilization is that
which declares that man should strive to benefit, not himself
alone, but his posterity.</p></div>

<h3 class="sc">I. The Origin of the Matriarchate.</h3>

<p>In the very beginning woman was, by function, a mother; by virtue of her
surroundings, a housewife. Man was then, as now, the active, dominant
factor in those affairs outside the immediate pale of the fireside. Life
was collective; &ldquo;communal was the habitation, and communal the
wives with the children; the men pursued the same prey, and devoured it
together after the manner of wolves; all felt, all thought, all acted in
concert.&rdquo; Primitive men were like their simian ancestors, which
never paired, and which roamed through the forest in bands and troops.
This collectivism is plainly noticeable in certain races<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of primitive folks which are yet in existence, notably the autochthons
of the Aleutian Islands. Huddled together in their communal <i>kachims</i>,
naked, without any thought of immodesty, men, women, and children share
the same fire and eat from the same pot. They recognize no immorality in
the fact of the father cohabiting with his daughter&mdash;one of them
na&iuml;vely remarking to Langsdorf, who reproached him for having
committed this crime: &ldquo;Why not? the otters do it!&rdquo; Later in
life the men and women mate; but even then there is no sanctity in the
marriage tie, for the Aleutian will freely offer his wife to the
stranger within his gates, and will consider it an insult if he refuses
to enjoy her company. &ldquo;As with many savages and half-civilized
people, the man who would not offer his guest the hospitality of the
conjugal couch, or the company of his best-looking daughter, would be
considered an ill-bred person.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
This laxity in sexual relations was, at first, common to all races of
primitive men, but, after a time, there arose certain influences which
modified, to a certain extent, this free and indiscriminate intercourse.
Frequent wars must have occurred between hostile tribes of primitive
men, during which, some of them (physically or numerically weaker than
their opponents) must have been repeatedly vanquished, and many of their
females captured, for, in those old days (like those of more recent
times, for that matter) the women were the prizes for which the men
fought.</p>

<p>Under circumstances like these, the few remaining women must have served
as wives for all the men of the tribe; and, in this manner polyandry had
its inception. Polyandry gives women certain privileges which monandry
denies, and she is not slow to seize on these prerogatives, and to use
them in the furtherance of her own welfare. Polyandry, originating from
any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
cause whatever, will always end in the establishment of a matriarchate,
in which the women are either directly or indirectly at the head of the
government.</p>

<p>There are several matriarchates still extant in the world, and one of
the best known, as well as the most advanced, as far as civilization and
culture are concerned, is that of the Nairs, a people of India
inhabiting that portion of the country lying between Cape Comorin and
Mangalore, and the Gh&acirc;ts and the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The Nairs are described as being the handsomest people in the world; the
men being tall, sinewy and extraordinarily agile, while the women are
slender and graceful, with perfectly modeled figures. The Nair girl is
carefully chaperoned until she arrives at a marriageable age, say,
fourteen or fifteen years, at which time some complaisant individual is
selected, who goes through the marriage ceremony with her. As soon as
the groom ties the <i>tali</i>, or marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
cord, about her neck, he is feasted and is then dismissed; the wife must
never again speak to, or even look at, her husband. Once safely wedded,
the girl becomes emancipated, and can receive the attentions of as many
men as she may elect, though, I am informed, it is not considered
fashionable, at present, to have more than seven husbands, one for each
day of the week.</p>

<p>Of no importance heretofore, after her farcical marriage the Nair woman
at once becomes a power in the councils of the nation; as a matter of
course, the higher her lovers the higher her rank becomes and the
greater her influence. Here is female suffrage in its primitive form,
brought about, it is true, by environment, and not by elective
franchise.</p>

<p>As far as the children are concerned, the power of the mother is
absolute; for they know no father, the maternal uncle standing in his
stead. Property, both personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and real, is vested in the woman; she is the mistress and the ruler.
&ldquo;The mother reigns and governs; she has her eldest daughter for
prime minister in her household, through whom all orders are transmitted
to her little world. Formerly, in grand ceremonials, the reigning prince
himself yielded precedence to his eldest daughter, and, of course,
recognized still more humbly the priority of his mother, before whom he
did not venture to seat himself until she had given him permission. Such
was the rule from the palace to the humblest dwelling of a Nair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the past fifty years, these people have made rapid strides toward
civilization, monandry and monogamy taking the places of polyandry and
polygamy, and fifty or a hundred years hence, this matriarchate will, in
all probability, entirely disappear.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated, I think, clearly and distinctly, that matriarchy,
or female<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
government, is neither new nor advanced thought, but that it is as old,
almost, as the human race; that the &ldquo;New Woman&rdquo; was born
many thousands of years ago, and that her autotype, in some respects, is
to be found to-day in Mangalore! A return to matriarchy at the present
time would be distinctly and emphatically and essentially retrograde in
every particular. The right to vote carries with it the right to hold
office, and if women are granted the privilege of suffrage, they must
also be given the right to govern. Now let us see if we cannot find a
reason for this atavistic desire (matriarchy) in the physical and
psychical histories of its foremost advocates. I will discuss this
question in Part II of this paper.</p>

<h3 class="sc">II. The Viragint.</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of genius. The first is progressive genius, which
always enunciates new and original matter of material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
benefit to the human race, and which is, consequently, non-atavistic;
the second is atavistic or retrogressive genius, which is imitative and
which always enunciates dead and obsolete matter long since abandoned
and thrown aside as being utterly useless. The doctrines of communism
and of nihilism are the products of retrogressive genius and are clearly
atavistic, inasmuch as they are a reversion to the mental habitudes of
our savage ancestors. The doctrines of the matriarchate are likewise
degenerate beliefs, and, if held by any civilized being of to-day, are
evidences of psychic atavism.</p>

<p>Atavism invariably attacks the weak; and individuals of neurasthenic
type are more frequently its victims than are any other class of people.
Especially is this true in the case of those who suffer from psychical
atavism.</p>

<p>The woman of to-day who believes in and inculcates the doctrines of
matriarchy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
doctrines which have been, as far as the civilized world is concerned,
thrown aside and abandoned these many hundred years, is as much the
victim of psychic atavism as was Alice Mitchell, who slew Freda Ward in
Memphis several years ago, and who was justly declared a viragint by the
court that tried her.</p>

<p>Without entering into the truthfulness or falseness of the theory
advanced by me elsewhere in this book, in regard to the primal cause of
psychic hermaphroditism, which I attributed and do still attribute to
psychic atavism, I think that I am perfectly safe in asserting that
every woman who has been at all prominent in advancing the cause of
equal rights in its entirety, has either given evidences or
masculo-femininity (viraginity), or has shown, conclusively, that she
was the victim of psycho-sexual aberrancy. Moreover, the history of
every viragint of any note in the history of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
world shows that they were either physically or psychically degenerate,
or both.</p>

<p>Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc was the victim of hystero-epilepsy, while Catharine
the Great was a dipsomaniac, and a creature of unbounded and inordinate
sensuality. Messalina, the depraved wife of Claudius, a woman of
masculine type, whose very form embodied and shadowed forth the regnant
idea of her mind&mdash;absolute and utter rulership&mdash;was a woman of such
gross carnality, that her lecherous conduct shocked even the depraved
courtiers of her lewd and salacious court. The side-lights of history,
as Douglas Campbell has so cleverly pointed out in his &ldquo;Puritan in
Holland, England, and America,&rdquo; declare that there is every reason
to believe that the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth of England, was not such a
pure and unspotted virgin as her admirers make her out to be. Sir Robert
Cecil says of her that &ldquo;she was more man than woman,&rdquo; while
history shows conclusively that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was a pronounced viragint, with a slight tendency toward megalomania. In
a recent letter to me, Mr. George H. Yeaman, ex-Minister to Denmark,
writes as follows: &ldquo;Whether it be the relation of cause and
effect, or only what logicians call a &ldquo;mere coincidence,&rdquo;
the fact remains that in Rome, Russia, France, and England, political
corruption, cruelty of government, sexual immorality&mdash;nay,
downright, impudent, open, boastful indecency&mdash;have culminated, for
the most part, in the eras of the influence of viragints on government
or over governors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viraginity has many phases. We see a mild form of it in the tom-boy who
abandons her dolls and female companions for the marbles and masculine
sports of her boy acquaintances. In the loud-talking, long-stepping,
slang-using young woman we see another form; while the
square-shouldered, stolid, cold, unemotional, unfeminine android (for
she has the normal human form,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
without the normal human <i>psychos</i>) is yet another. The most aggravated
form of viraginity is that known as homo-sexuality; with this form,
however, this paper has nothing to do.</p>

<p>Another form of viraginity is technically known as gynandry, and may be
defined as follows: A victim of gynandry not only has the feelings and
desires of a man, but also the skeletal form, features, voice, etc., so
that the individual approaches the opposite sex anthropologically, and
in more than a psycho-sexual way (Krafft-Ebing).</p>

<p>As it is probable that this form of viraginity is sometimes acquired to
a certain extent, and that, too, very quickly, when a woman is placed
among the proper surroundings, I shall give the case of Sarolta,
Countess V., one of the most remarkable instances of gynandry on record.
If this woman, when a child, had been treated as a girl, she would in
all probability have gone through life as a woman, for she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
born a female in every sense of the word. At a very early age, however,
her father, who was an exceedingly eccentric nobleman, dressed her in
boy&rsquo;s clothing, called her Sandor, and taught her boyish games and
sports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarolta-Sandor remained under her father&rsquo;s influence till
her twelfth year, and then came under the care of her maternal
grandmother, in Dresden, by whom, when the masculine play became too
obvious, she was placed in an institute and made to wear female attire.
At thirteen she had a love relation with an English girl, to whom she
represented herself as a boy, and ran away with her. She was finally
returned to her mother, who could do nothing with her, and was forced to
allow her to resume the name of Sandor and to put on boy&rsquo;s
clothes. She accompanied her father on long journeys, always as a young
gentleman; she became a <i>rou&eacute;</i>, frequenting brothels and <i>caf&eacute;s</i> and
often becoming intoxicated. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of her sports were masculine; so were her tastes and so were her
desires. She had many love affairs with women, always skillfully hiding
the fact that she herself was a woman. She even carried her masquerade
so far as to enter into matrimony with the daughter of a distinguished
official and to live with her for some time before the imposition was
discovered.&rdquo; The woman whom Sandor married is described as being
&ldquo;a girl of incredible simplicity and innocence;&rdquo; in sooth,
she must have been!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this woman&rsquo;s passion for those of her own sex, she
distinctly states that in her thirteenth year she experienced normal
sexual desire. Her environments, however, had been those of a male
instead of a female, consequently her psychical weakness, occasioned by
degeneration inherited from an eccentric father, turned her into the
gulf of viraginity, from which she at last emerged, a victim of complete
gynandry. I have given this instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
more prominence than it really deserves, simply because I wish to call
attention to the fact that environment is one of the great factors in
evolutionary development.</p>

<p>Many women of to-day who are in favor of female suffrage are influenced
by a single idea; they have some great reform in view, such as the
establishment of universal temperance, or the elevation of social
morals. Suffrage in its entirety, that suffrage which will give them a
share in the government, is not desired by them; they do not belong to
the class of viragints, unsexed individuals, whose main object is the
establishment of a matriarchate.</p>

<p>Woman is a creature of the emotions, of impulses, of sentiment, and of
feeling; in her the logical faculty is subordinate. She is influenced by
the object immediately in view, and does not hesitate to form a judgment
which is based on no other grounds save those of intuition. Logical men
look beyond the immediate effects of an action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and predicate its results on posterity. The percepts and recepts which
form the concept of equal rights also embody an eject which, though
conjectural, is yet capable of logical demonstration, and which declares
that the final and ultimate effect of female suffrage on posterity would
be exceedingly harmful.</p>

<p>We have seen that the pronounced advocates and chief promoters of equal
rights are probably viragints&mdash;individuals who plainly show that they
are psychically abnormal; furthermore, we have seen that the abnormality
is occasioned by degeneration, either acquired or inherent, in the
individual. Now let us see, if the right of female suffrage were
allowed, what effect it would produce on the present environment of the
woman of to-day, and, if any, what effect this changed environment would
have on the psychical habitudes of the woman of the future. This portion
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the subject will be discussed in Part III of this paper.</p>

<h3 class="sc">III. The Decadence.</h3>

<p>It is conceded that man completed his cycle of physical development many
thousands of years ago. Since his evolution from his pithecoid ancestor
the forces of nature have been at work evolving man&rsquo;s psychical
being. Now, man&rsquo;s psychical being is intimately connected with,
and dependent upon, his physical being; therefore it follows that
degeneration of his physical organism will necessarily engender
psychical degeneration also. Hence, if I can prove that woman, by
leading a life in which her present environments are changed, produces
physical degeneration, it will naturally follow that psychical
degeneration will also accrue; and, since one of the invariable results
of degeneration, both physical and psychical, is atavism, the phenomenon
of a social revolution in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
which the present form of government will be overthrown and a
matriarchate established in its stead, will be not a possibility of the
future, but a probability.</p>

<p>That the leaders of this movement in favor of equal rights look for such
a result, I have not the slightest doubt; for, not many days ago, Susan
B. Anthony stood beside the chair of a circuit judge in one of our
courthouses and, before taking her seat, remarked that there were those
in her audience who doubtless thought &ldquo;that she was guilty of
presumption and usurpation&rdquo; (in taking the judge&rsquo;s chair),
but that there would come a day when they would no longer think so!</p>

<p>Statistics show clearly and conclusively that there is an alarming
increase of suicide and insanity among women, and I attribute this
wholly to the already changed environment of our women. As the matter
stands they have already too much liberty. The restraining influences
which formerly made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
woman peculiarly a housewife have been, in a measure, removed, and woman
mixes freely with the world. Any new duty added to woman as a member of
society would modify her environment to some extent and call for
increased nervous activity. When a duty like suffrage is added the
change in her environment must necessarily be marked and radical, with
great demands for an increased activity. The right of suffrage would,
unquestionably, very materially change the environment of woman at the
present time, and would entail new and additional desires and emotions
which would be other and most exhausting draughts on her nervous
organism.</p>

<p>The effects of degeneration are slow in making their appearance, yet
they are exceedingly certain. The longer woman lived amid surroundings
calling for increased nervous expenditure, the greater would be the
effects of the accruing degeneration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
on her posterity. &ldquo;Periods of moral decadence in the life of a
people are always contemporaneous with times of effeminacy, sensuality,
and luxury. These conditions can only be conceived as occurring with
increased demands on the nervous system, which must meet these
requirements. As a result of increase of nervousness there is increase
of sensuality, and since this leads to excess among the masses it
undermines the foundations of society&mdash;the morality and purity of
family life&rdquo; (Krafft-Ebing).</p>

<p>The inherited psychical habitudes, handed down through hundreds and
thousands of years, would prevent the immediate destruction of that
ethical purity for which woman is noted, and in the possession of which
she stands so far above man. I do not think that this ethical purity
would be lost in a day or a year, or a hundred years, for that matter;
yet there would come a time when the morality of to-day would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
be utterly lost, and society would sink into some such state of
existence as we now find <i>en evidence</i> among the Nairs. In support of
this proposition I have only to instance the doctrines promulgated by
some of the most advanced advocates of equal rights. The &ldquo;free
love&rdquo; of some advanced women, I take it, is but the free choice
doctrine in vogue among the Nairs and kindred races of people.</p>

<p>John Noyes, of the Oneida Community, where equal rights were observed,
preached the same doctrines. It is true that the people who advocate
such unethical principles are degenerate individuals, psychical
atavists, yet they faithfully foreshadow in their own persons that which
would be common to all men and women at some time in the future, if
equal rights were allowed, and carried out in their entirety.</p>

<p>This is an era of luxury, and it is a universally acknowledged fact that
luxury is one of the prime factors in the production<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of degeneration. We see forms and phases of degeneration thickly
scattered throughout all circles of society, in the plays which we see
performed in our theaters, and in the books and papers published daily
throughout the land. The greater portion of the <i>client&egrave;le</i> of
the alienist and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The
original read 'neuroloogist'.">neurologist</ins> is made up of women who are
suffering with neurotic troubles, generally of a psychopathic nature.
The number of viragints, gynandrists, androgynes, and other
psycho-sexual aberrants of the feminine gender is very large indeed.</p>

<p>It is folly to deny the fact that the right of female suffrage will make
no change in the environment of woman. The New Woman glories in the
fact, that the era which she hopes to inaugurate will introduce her into
a new world. Not satisfied with the liberty she now enjoys, and which is
proving to be exceedingly harmful to her in more ways than one, she
longs for more freedom, a broader field of action. If nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
provided men and women with an inexhaustible supply of nervous energy,
they might set aside physical laws, and burn the candle at both ends
without any fear of its being burned up. Nature furnishes each
individual with just so much nervous force and no more; moreover, she
holds every one strictly accountable for every portion of nervous energy
which he or she may squander; therefore, it behooves us to build our
causeway with exceeding care, otherwise we will leave a chasm which will
engulf posterity.</p>

<p>The baneful effects resulting from female suffrage will not be seen
to-morrow, or next week, or week after next, or next month, or next
year, or a hundred years hence, perhaps. It is not a question of our day
and generation; it is a matter involving posterity. The simple right to
vote carries with it no immediate danger, the danger comes afterward;
probably many years after the establishment of female suffrage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
when woman, owing to her increased degeneration, gives free rein to her
atavistic tendencies, and hurries ever backward toward the savage state
of her barbarian ancestors. I see, in the establishment of equal rights,
the first step toward that abyss of immoral horrors so repugnant to our
cultivated ethical tastes&mdash;the matriarchate. Sunk as low as this,
civilized man will sink still lower&mdash;to the communal <i>kachims</i> of
the Aleutian Islanders.</p>

<h2><a name="IS_IT_THE_BEGINNING_OF_THE_END" id="IS_IT_THE_BEGINNING_OF_THE_END"></a>IS IT THE BEGINNING OF THE END?</h2>

<p>When we come to examine the history of the world we find evidence that
certain nations have, at times, reached a high state of prosperity, and
have then degenerated to such a degree that they have either passed
entirely out of existence, or have lapsed into a state of
semi-barbarity. This has generally been brought about by conquest, but
the races conquered had first become enfeebled by their habitudes of
thought and manner of living. It is a well-established fact that luxury
brings debauchery, and that debauchery occasions degeneration. All
nations that have, heretofore, reached the zenith of their prosperity,
have been engulfed, at some time or other, in the maelstrom of luxurious
habits, and have fallen under the lethal influence of a degeneration
occasioned solely by debauchery; for the luxury and debauchery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of one class brought increased poverty on, as well as excess in, other
classes, and poverty and excess are prominent factors in the production
of degeneration, as we shall see further on in this paper. Says the
brilliant author of &ldquo;Psychopathia Sexualis,&rdquo; Krafft-Ebing:
&ldquo;Periods of moral decadence in the life of a people are always
contemporaneous with times of effeminacy, sensuality, and luxury. These
conditions can only be conceived as occurring with increased demands
upon the nervous system, which must meet these requirements. As a result
of increase of nervousness, there is increase of sensuality, and, since
this leads to excesses among the masses, it undermines the foundations
of society&mdash;the morality and purity of family life. When this is
destroyed by excesses, unfaithfulness, and luxury, then the destruction
of the state is inevitably compassed in material, moral, and political
ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the condition of the Latin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
race when the fierce and hardy Vandals overran the Roman peninsula; such
was the condition of the Assyrians when Babylon fell beneath the
onslaughts of the great Macedonian; such was the condition of the
Egyptians when the northern myriads swept down upon the fertile valley
of the Nile, and destroyed forever the once powerful and all-conquering
kingdom of the Pharaohs; and such, too, was the condition of the French
nation in 1794, when Anarchy unfurled its red banner at the head of the
most gigantic social revolution the world has ever known.</p>

<p>At the present time, community of interests, as well as higher
civilization, would utterly forbid the total subjugation of one
civilized nation by another, such as occurred in the olden times; hence
no nation need fear annihilation from such a source. The danger comes
from another point, and consists in the almost certain uprising, at some
time in the future, of degenerate individuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in open warfare and rebellion against society.</p>

<p>The question whether the world is growing better or worse is often
debated, and can be answered affirmatively on both sides. Better,
because superstition, bigotry, and dogmatism have given way, to a great
extent, to the tolerance and freedom of higher civilization and purer
ethics in normal, healthy man; worse, because crime (and I mean by crime
<i>all</i> anti-social acts) has greatly increased on account of the
pernicious influence of degeneration.</p>

<p>That superstition, bigotry, and dogmatism are on the wane, and that they
will, sooner or later, be entombed in that depository of obsolete savage
mental habitudes&mdash;absolute and utter oblivion&mdash;a glance at the success
that science has achieved in the warfare waged against it by the Church,
will at once declare. (Throughout this article I use the word Church to
express priests of any and every denomination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
whether Jew, Gentile, or Pagan, Protestant or Catholic.) A short
incursion into this subject, <i>i. e.</i>, the Church&rsquo;s warfare on
science, is absolutely necessary. For the triumph of science over its
enemies&mdash;superstition, bigotry, and dogmatism, coincidently,
ignorance and illiterateness&mdash;shows that the civilized world, at
the present time, is markedly different in some respects from the world
of ancient, medieval, and even comparatively recent times; and, in
summing up, this changed condition will be a weighty factor in making up
an answer to the question which heads this paper.</p>

<p>When Olympus first faded away from the enlightened eyesight of the
Greeks, and changed into space besprinkled with stars; when Zeus no
longer held his divine court on its mystic summit; when oracles became
mute and the fabled wonders of the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; either
vanished, or resolved themselves into prosaic commonplaces under the
investigations of the skeptic or the accidental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
discoverer, the Church made a most strenuous protest against the
destruction of its traditions.</p>

<p>Many of these early seekers after truth were even killed and their goods
confiscated. The Church issued its edict against heresy (and any
doctrine that taught a belief antagonistic to the accepted tenets of
pagan mythology and theogony was heresy), and hurled its anathemas
against the heretic. Olympus, in the eyes of the Church, still existed,
and Zeus, the man-god, still quaffed the sacred ambrosia in its shady
groves. The Sirens still sang their entrancing songs, while Scylla and
Charybdis were ever stretching out eager arms toward unwary mariners.
Gigantic one-eyed Cyclops, with Polyphemus as their leader, still
patrolled the shores of Sicily, and kept their &ldquo;ever-watchful
eyes&rdquo; turned toward the open sea.</p>

<p>The hardy Greek sailor landed on the Cyclopean island, and discovered
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Polyphemus, and Arges, and Brontes, and Steropes, and all the other
one-eyed monsters were nothing but sea-wrack, bowlders, and weeds. He
sailed farther, past Scylla and Charybdis, and discovered no greater
dangers than sharp rocks and whirlpools. Yet farther he sailed out into
the unknown sea, and the only Siren&rsquo;s song he heard was the
whistling of the wind through the cordage of his vessel.</p>

<p>In vain the Church thundered against the daring investigator. Neither
fire, nor sword, nor imprisonment, nor death itself could check the
march of truth. Mythology and pagan theogony had received their
death-blows; superstition, bigotry, and dogmatism were elbowed aside and
gave place to dawning science. The Church held that that which had been
believed by pious men for untold ages must necessarily be true. Science,
in the garb of philosophy, with cold, dispassionate criticism, proved
that these hitherto accepted truths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
were arrant fallacies. The poets and writers then took up the subject,
and finally the people fell into line, so superstitious, bigoted,
dogmatic mythology died, intellectuality took its place, and higher
civilization took a step forward.</p>

<p>Thomas H. Huxley writes, in his preface to &ldquo;Science and Christian
Tradition,&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;I have never &lsquo;gone out of my
way&rsquo; to attack the Bible or anything else; it was the dominant,
ecclesiasticism of my early days, which, as I believe, without any
warrant from the Bible itself, thrust the book in my way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had set out on a journey, with no other purpose than that of
exploring a certain province of natural knowledge; I strayed no
hair&rsquo;s breadth from the course which it was my right and my duty
to pursue; and yet I found that, whatever route I took, before long I
came to a tall and formidable looking fence. Confident as I might be in
the existence of an ancient and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
indefeasible right of way, before me stood the thorny barrier with its
comminatory notice-board&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="sc">No Thoroughfare.</span> By order.
<span class="sc">Moses</span>.&rsquo; There seemed no way over; nor did the prospect of creeping
round, as I saw some do attract me&hellip; The only alternatives were
either to give up my journey&mdash;which I was not minded to do&mdash;or
to break the fence down and go through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huxley found that this Mosaic fence, as erected by dogmatic theologians
and scholasticists, was but a flimsy structure at best, and one that was
easily overthrown and destroyed.</p>

<p>Dogmatic theology teaches that man was created from the dust of the
earth, and that he at once fell heir to an estate of physical and
psychical habitudes which were God-like in character; scientific
investigation, on the contrary, demonstrated the fact that man&rsquo;s
inception begins in bathybian protoplasm and culminates, as far as his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
general physical organism is concerned, in the last link of an
evolutionary chain that reaches back and back, through countless eons of
ages, to the very beginnings of life.</p>

<p>The History of Life written upon the rocky frame-work of this gray and
hoary old world, declares that man&rsquo;s physical being is but the
result of the laws of evolution. He did not spring into being, like the
sea-born Venus, a creature of physical grace, and strength, and beauty;
nor did the sacred flame of an inborn intelligence at once illumine his
countenance. For thousands of years, the forbears of the present
civilized <i>homo sapiens</i> were but slightly above the <i>Alalus</i> (ape-like
man) of Haeckel in point of personal pulchritude; and for thousands of
years, the ancestors of the civilized man of to-day were savages, with
all the psychical traits of primitive peoples.</p>

<p>Social ethics are as much the result of evolutionary growth as is man
himself. Civilization, which is but another name for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
ethical culture, is the outcome of the inherited experiences of
thousands of years. These experiences were the results of law, and that
law can be embraced in one comprehensive word&mdash;evolution.</p>

<p>Now, one of the most noticeable facts in biological history is the
tendency that animal structures or organisms, under certain
circumstances, have toward atavism or reversion to ancestral types. Not
only is this to be observed in the physical organisms of animals, but
also in their psychical beings as well.</p>

<p>Atavism is invariably the result of degeneration, as I will endeavor to
demonstrate later on in this paper.</p>

<p>I believe that we are rapidly hurrying toward a social cataclysm, beside
which the downfall of the Roman Empire, the destruction of ancient
Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations, and the bloody days of the French
Revolution will sink into utter insignificance. I believe, also, and
think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that I can demonstrate the truthfulness of my belief, that the inciting
cause of this social revolution will not be found in those citizens of
the United States of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic parentage, but that it will
be observed among our Slavonic, Teutonic, and Latinic citizens. But, in
order to furnish a parallel (from which you may draw your own
conclusions), before I enter fully into the discussion of this part of
my subject, I wish to review, very briefly, certain historical epochs.</p>

<p>When the first conquerors of Egypt, about whom history can tell us so
little, first occupied the fertile valley of the Nile, the country, in
all probability, was inhabited by negroes. The conquering race drove out
or enslaved the native population and founded the ancient kingdom of
Egypt. This kingdom waxed strong and mighty until, at the time of
Rameses the Great, more than three thousand two hundred years ago, it
was the most powerful monarchy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in the whole world. The mighty son of Ra, Meiamoun Ra, or Rameses, as he
is most generally styled, was a warrior and a statesman. He led his
victorious troops north, east, and west, conquering nations as he went,
until he dominated and brought into a state of vassalage over two-thirds
of the then known world.</p>

<p>Wealth flowed into his kingdom from all the surrounding countries,
consequently, luxury, with its never-failing associate, debauchery, made
its appearance, and the decadence of this mighty kingdom set in.</p>

<p>It is true that many Pharaohs reigned after Rameses, and that the
monarchy maintained its greatness for a long period of time, but luxury
had taken hold on the Egyptians at the time of their greatest prosperity
and had sown the seeds of degeneration, which flourished and grew apace,
until the emasculated and effeminate people yielded up their
independence to the conquerors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and passed out of existence as a nation forever.</p>

<p>The Roman people, under the leadership of their ancient heroes, was a
nation of hardy warriors and husbandmen. That pre&euml;minent military
genius, Julius C&aelig;sar, had carefully fostered this warlike spirit in the
bosoms of his compatriots, and, by a series of brilliant campaigns, had
made the Roman nation the most powerful on the face of the globe. The
Roman legions were not only victorious on land, extending their
conquests into Iberia, farther Gaul, and still farther <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'Brittain'.">Britain</ins>,
but the Roman triremes also swept the Mediterranean, from the Pillars of
Hercules to the shores of Syria and Egypt. Wealth poured into the
country from all sides, and the people reveled in a boundless
prosperity.</p>

<p>Luxury had already begun to enervate the hardy soldiery at the time of
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s assassination, yet not enough to show the full effects of
degeneration and demoralization.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The empire under the first emperors steadily grew richer and more
powerful, and the luxury of the rich more unlimited and licentious. At
length a change can be noticed. The Roman legions, hitherto victorious
over every foe, are now frequently vanquished; conquered tribes uprear
the standard of revolt and refuse to pay tribute; the territorial
boundaries of the empire materially shrink, and its once conquered
provinces pass out of its dominion forever.</p>

<p>The gradual degeneration of this nation is faithfully mirrored in the
character of the emperors who governed it. Nero, Caligula, Tiberius,
Caracalla, and Messalina, the depraved wife of Claudius and the daughter
of Domitia Lepida, herself a licentious and libidinous woman, were but
accentuated types of the luxurious and debauched nobility. Not only did
the nobility become victims of degeneration, but the poorer classes also
lost their virility, until at last we find the stability of the nation
preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
through the instrumentality of foreign mercenaries. The greatness of
this once widespread empire dwindled away (the freedom of its
institutions contracting along with its shrinking boundaries), until we
find it lapsed into a state of barbarian despotism under the son of
Aurelius; and, had it not been for outside influences, it would have
eventually fallen into a state of utter and complete savagery.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to a recent civilization. At the time of Louis XVI., the
French nation was thoroughly under the influence of degeneration
consequent to a luxury and licentiousness that had had a cumulative
action for several hundred years. The peasantry and the inhabitants of
the faubourgs, owing to their extreme poverty, itself a powerful factor
in the production of degeneration, had lapsed into a state closely akin
to that of their savage ancestors. The nobility were weak and
effeminate, the majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of them either sexual perverts or monsters of sensuality and lechery.</p>

<p>The middle class, as ever the true conservators of society, seeing this
miserable state of affairs, attempted to remedy it. Not fully
understanding the danger of such a procedure, they allowed the
degenerate element to share in their deliberations. Their moderate and
sensible counsels were quickly overruled by their savage associates, who
brought about a Reign of Terror (with such psychical atavists as Marat,
Danton, and Robespierre at its head), the like of which the world had
never seen before, nor has ever experienced since.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated, in the three instances of history just cited, that
degeneration has invariably followed luxury, and that a social and
political cataclysm has been, invariably, the result of this
degeneration. That certain classes of the Old World, and of the New
World, also, are living in inordinate luxury; and that certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
other classes are, even now, struggling in the very depths of poverty,
is a well-known fact. That this state of affairs is rapidly increasing
the percentage of degenerates, such as sexual perverts, insane
individuals, and congenital criminals, is not generally known; yet it is
a woeful truth.</p>

<p>The factors in the production of degeneration are as multitudinous as
they are varied, and I can find space for only a few of them. The
artificiality of many peoples&rsquo; lives, wherein night is turned into
day, is a prominent factor in the production of degeneration. Now, the
long continued influence of artificial light exerts a very deleterious
effect on the nervous system; hence it is not to be wondered at that so
many men and women of society are neurasthenic. Not only are those
individuals who, voluntarily and preferably, spend the greater portions
of their lives in artificial light, rendered nervously irritable, but
those, also, who are driven by force of circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to turn night into day are likewise afflicted. Several years ago, I met
a distinguished editor at Waukesha, who was suffering greatly from
nervous exhaustion. He told me that he was so situated that he did all
of his work at night, often writing until three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning. I advised him to quit this and to do his editorial work during
daylight. Not long after, he wrote me that he had followed my advice,
and that he was a new man in point of health.</p>

<p>The loss of nervous vitality makes itself evident by a feeling either of
exhaustion or irritability. The fashionable devotee, in order to
counteract this, either stimulates the system with alcohol, or exorcises
the &ldquo;fidgets&rdquo; by the use of sedatives, such as chloral or
morphia. The baneful effects of such medication are not at once
appreciable, but, if continued for any length of time, they will
eventually result in a total demoralization of the nervous system.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Time and again have I seen fashionable men and women, at the close of
the season, veritable nervous wrecks.</p>

<p>What necessarily would be the effect of physical and psychical lesions
like these on a child begotten by such parents? The inevitable result
would be degeneration in some form or other.</p>

<p>Again, many men and women stand the drain of a fashionable season on
their nervous systems without attempting to recoup through the agency of
drugs, and at the end find themselves physically and psychically
exhausted. They go to the seaside or some other resort, and, in a
measure, recover their nervous vitality, only to lose it again during
the next season. This continues for season after season, the nervous
system all the time becoming weaker, until some day there is a collapse,
ending in hysteria, paresis, or some other of the hundred forms of
neurotic disorder. What will be the effect on the progeny resulting from
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
union of such individuals? Again the answer must necessarily
be&mdash;degeneration.</p>

<p>The long and continued intercourse of the sexes in the ball-room, where
the women are dressed so <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> that they excite sensuality in the
men, very frequently without the men being conscious of the fact, must
necessarily exert a deleterious effect on the nervous system.</p>

<p>Contact of the sexes in the dance is only pleasurable because of that
contact. I am fully aware of the fact that this idea is scouted and
denied by those who indulge in the waltz and kindred dances. They claim
that no thought of carnality ever enters into their feelings. I know
from personal experiences that they are honest in this declaration, yet,
from a psychical standpoint, they are woefully in error. Aestheticism
and carnality are by no means as dissociate as the &aelig;sthete would have us
believe. <i>All pleasurable emotions that have their inception in the
senses are, fundamentally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of carnal origin.</i> The waltz is &aelig;sthetic, yet all of its pleasure
is based on an emotion closely akin to sensuality. Men derive no
pleasure from waltzing with one another, nor do women under like
circumstances.</p>

<p>Nature demands in the interest of health a certain amount of exercise.
The luxurious society man or woman utterly disregards this demand of
nature, consequently indigestion, with all of its associated ills, steps
in, and becomes an additional factor in the production of nervous
exhaustion. To tempt the appetite, highly seasoned foods, many of which
are deleterious and injurious, are prepared and taken into the torpid
and crippled stomach. Finally nature rebels and the unfortunate
dyspeptic is forced to go through life on a diet of oatmeal, or,
weakened by lack of healthy sustenance, the brain gives way, and the
victim passes the remainder of his or her life in a lunatic asylum.
Children begotten by miserable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
invalids like these, beyond a peradventure, must necessarily be
degenerate.</p>

<p>Indigestion is not the only ill that nature inflicts for any disregard
of her laws. She is a rough nurse but a safe one, consequently she
forbids the rearing of her hardiest creation, man, in hot houses, as
though he were a tender exotic. The luxurious individual pampers his
body, following the dictates of his own selfish desires and utterly
disregarding the laws of nature, and before he reaches middle age,
discovers that he has become an old, old man, weak in body, but still
weaker in mind.</p>

<p>The children resulting from the union of the various neurasthenics
described above are necessarily degenerate. As they grow up, they show
this degeneration by engaging in all kinds of licentious debauchery, and
unnatural and perverted indulgences of appetite. In nine cases out of
ten, they will spend the fortunes inherited from their parents in
riotous debauchery, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
will eventually sink, if death does not overtake them, to the level of
their fellow degenerates&mdash;those who have been brought into
existence by poverty and debauchery, and who await them at the foot of
the social ladder. Among such degenerate beings, the doctrines of
socialism, of communism, of nihilism, and of anarchy have their origin.</p>

<p>Now let us turn our attention to the evidences of luxury and debauchery,
and the consequent evidences of degeneration, which obtrude themselves
on all sides. The reckless extravagance of the nobility of the Old World
is well known. Vice and licentiousness even penetrate to royal
households, and princes of the blood pose as rou&eacute;s and debauchees. As I
have demonstrated elsewhere, degeneration in the wealthy classes of
society generally makes itself evident by the appearance of
psycho-sexual disorders. The horrible abominations of the English
nobility, as portrayed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
revelations of Mr. Stead, are well known. Charcot, Segal&acirc;s,
F&eacute;r&eacute;, and Bouvier give clear and succinct accounts of the
vast amount of sexual perversion existing among the French, while
Krafft-Ebing informs us that the German empire is cursed by the presence
of thousands of these unfortunates. When we come to examine this phase
of degeneration in our own country, we find that it is very prevalent.
This is especially noticeable in the larger cities, though we find
examples of it scattered broadcast throughout the land.</p>

<p>The editor of one of our leading magazines, in a remarkable series of
letters, has shown that the wealthy New Yorkers revel in a luxuriousness
that is absolutely startling in its license. Thousands are expended on a
single banquet, while the flower bills for a single year of some of
these modern Luculli would support a family of five people for three or
four years! Bacchanalian orgies that dim even those of the depraved,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
corrupt, and degenerate Nero are of nightly occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_AI_139" id="FNanchor_AI_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_139" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>
Drunkenness, lechery, and gambling are the sports and pastimes of these
ultra rich men, and it is even whispered that milady is not much behind
milord in the pursuit of forbidden pleasures.</p>

<p>Psycho-sexual disorders are not the only evidences of degeneration in
the wealthy, by any means. Many a congenital criminal is born in the
purple, who shows his moral imbecility in many ways. Sometimes he sinks
at once to the level of a common thief, but generally his education
keeps him within the pale of the law. Always, however, his sensuality is
unbounded, and he will hesitate at nothing in order to gratify his
desires. This unbridled license has already had its effect elsewhere. We
see that it has even corrupted the guardians and conservators of the
public peace. The recent investigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the police board of New York shows a degree of corruption that is
simply overwhelming, and that the same state of affairs exists in
Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, and other large cities, I have every
reason to believe.</p>

<p>There are yet other evidences of degeneration; witness the eroticism
that is to be found in our literature. Unless a book appeals to the
degenerate tastes of its readers it might just as well never have been
published. This is not cynicism; it is plain, unvarnished truth. Again,
turn to the stage, and we find the same thing. The tragedies and
comedies of Shakespeare are shelved, while immoral &ldquo;society
plays&rdquo; and &ldquo;living pictures&rdquo; and &ldquo;problem
plays&rdquo; hold the boards. Salacity, with only sufficient and that
is, degeneration. That which happened centuries ago will happen again,
for covering to hide downright lewdness, is everywhere apparent. Now
what is the result of this? There can be but one answer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
man is governed by the same laws of nature now as he was then.</p>

<p>Statistics show that insanity is markedly on the increase. This is not
to be wondered at when we take into consideration the fact that
debauchery is the rule, and not the exception, among certain classes of
people. Syphilis, one of the most productive causes of degeneration, is
exceedingly active throughout the whole civilized world. Blashko states
that one out of every ten men in the city of Berlin is tainted with this
terrible malady. This is wholly attributable to the unbounded sensuality
of the people. Crime of every description is rearing its hydra-head, and
clasping in its destroying embrace an alarming proportion of human
beings.</p>

<p>I have shown elsewhere, that the congenital criminal is the result of
degeneration, and that he comes from all classes of society. He is,
however, most frequently the product of the lower classes, and lives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and dies among his congeners. I have shown, also, that the anarchist,
the nihilist, and the socialist belong to the same category of
degenerate beings. Poverty, brought on by high taxation, by war, and by
overcrowding, has been, during the last millenary period, very fertile
in the production of degenerates in the Old World. Lack of food and
sanitation, the usual adjuncts of poverty, are powerful factors in the
production of degenerate individuals. The Old World has gotten rid of
these people as rapidly as possible by unloading them on our shores.
Year after year, practically without restriction, thousands of these
anti-social men and women have swarmed into our country, until we,
comparatively speaking, a nation just born, contain as many of these
undesirable citizens as any of the older nations. They still continue to
enter our gates, and we ourselves are adding to their number, as I have
shown, by our own production.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Some day&mdash;and I greatly fear that day is not very far distant&mdash;some
professional anarchist (for there are professional anarchists as well as
professional thieves) will consider the time ripe for rebellion, and,
raising the fraudulent cry of &ldquo;Labor against Capital!&rdquo;
instead of his legitimate cry of &ldquo;Rapine! Murder! Booty!&rdquo;
will lead this army of degenerates, composed of anarchists, nihilists,
sexual perverts, and congenital criminals, against society. And who will
bear the brunt of this savage irruption? The ultra-rich? By no means!
The great &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;&mdash;the true conservators of society
and civilization&mdash;will fight this battle. It will be a fight between
civilization and degeneration, and civilization will carry the day.
There would have been no French revolution had the middle class been as
wise then as it is to-day. It was taken by surprise at that savage,
bloody time, but as soon as it recovered, how quickly it brought order
out of chaos!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Education is the bulwark of civilization, and the great middle class,
freed of dogmatism, bigotry, and superstition, is welcoming education
with outstretched hands. It is gaining recruits, and is strengthening
its defenses, so that when the time comes its enemies may find it fully
prepared.</p>

<p>From the signs of the times and the evidence before me, I have no
hesitation in declaring that I believe that the beginning of the end is
at hand! This social cataclysm may not occur for many years, yet the
agencies through which it will finally be evolved are even now at work,
and are bringing the culmination of their labors ever nearer and nearer
as time passes!</p>

Clarke in his interesting book gives us some very readable stories anent
the ability of animals seeing imaginary objects. I myself have seen a
parrot with a marked case of <i>delirium tremens</i>, due to excessive use of
alcoholic stimulants (Vid. Author: <i>The Dawn of Reason</i>). Romanes also
gives valuable data in his <i>Mental Evolution</i> (in Animal, and in Man)
concerning this subject. The fox terrier (Vid. Author: <i>Dawn of Reason</i>)
which carried his dreams into his awakened state is apropos.</p></div>

That the patriarchs had their household gods, we have every reason for
believing; these household gods were, however, tutelary divinities, such
as were kept in the house of every Chaldean, and were not the images of
ancestors. Rachel, the wife of Jacob, stole the household gods of Laban,
her father, who is called a Syrian. Abraham himself was a Chaldean. Gen.
11:31; also Gen. 31:19-20.</p></div>

Masculine hetarism is still in vogue among many primitive peoples, and
is distinctly a religious rite. &ldquo;The Kanats of New Caledonia
frequently assemble at night in a cabin to give themselves up to this
kind of debauchery&hellip; In the whole of America, from north to south,
similar customs have existed or still exist.&rdquo; Letourneau: <i>The
Evolution of Marriage</i>, p. 62. The same author says: &ldquo;It was also
a widely spread custom throughout Polynesia, and even a special deity
presided over it. The Southern Californians did the same, and the
Spanish missionaries, on their arrival in the country, found men dressed
as women and assuming their part. They were trained to this from youth,
and often publicly married to the chiefs. Nero was evidently a mere
plagiarist. The existence of analogous customs has been proved against
the Guyacurus of La Plata, the natives of the Isthmus of Darien, the
tribes of Louisiana, and the ancient Illinois.&rdquo;</p></div>

Strabo, when writing of the Armenians, who were phallic worshipers,
says: &ldquo;It is the custom of the most illustrious personages to
consecrate their virgin daughters to this goddess (Ana&iuml;tis). This
in no way prevents them from finding husbands, even after they have
prostituted themselves for a long time in the temples of Ana&iuml;tis.
No man feels on this account any repugnance to take them as
wives.&rdquo; Strabo: vol. xi., 14; quoted also by Letourneau: <i>The
Evolution of Marriage</i>, p. 46.</p></div>

Among certain peoples the blood and the semen bore a close relationship;
by certain races they were considered analogous. The Old Testament, the
Vedas, the Sagas, and many references of Greek, Latin, Egyptian, Hindu,
and Persian mythology point to this as being conclusive.</p></div>

Speaking of the ceremony of priestly prelibation as it was practiced in
the Kingdom of Malabar, Forbes writes as follows: &ldquo;The
ecclesiastic power took precedence of the civil on this particular
point, and the sovereign himself passed under the yoke. Like the other
women, the queen had to submit to the right of prelibation exercised by
the high priest, who had a right to the first three nights, and who was
paid fifty pieces of gold besides for his trouble.&rdquo; Forbes:
<i>Oriental Memoirs</i>, vol. i, p. 446; quoted also by Letourneau: <i>The
Evolution of Marriage</i>, p. 48. De R&eacute;musat says that, in Cambodia,
the daughters of poor parents retain their virginity longer than their
richer sisters simply because they have not the money with which to pay
the priest for defloration!</p></div>

&ldquo;The people have put the idol named <i>Coppal</i> in a neighboring

pagoda or in the streets when the idol is carried out in state,&rdquo;
writes Letourneau in <i>The Evolution of Marriage</i>, quoting from <i>Letters
&eacute;difiantes</i>. <i>Coppal</i> was and is a Brahminical Venus, and her
worship is wholly phallic in character. The ancient Indo-Iranians
worshiped a similar deity. The worship of Coppal, both in ritual and in
significance, is identical with that of the Greek Aphrodite.</p></div>

The author is fully aware of the fact that writers on phallic worship
ascribe other reasons for the adoption of the snake as one of the chief
symbols of the worship of the generative principle. He believes,
however, that the primitive originators of this cult were, psychically,
too immature to evolve any other than simple and objective ideas in
regard to this subject; hence he considers the above as the true origin
of this symbol. Furthermore, this belief is strengthened by the
appearance of the snake in the myths and folklore tales of
race-preservation in all peoples where the serpent was a familiar
object.</p></div>

A well informed Jesuit priest once told me that several laws had been
made about this time forbidding the worship of the female sexual organ,
under the name of <i>abricot</i> or <i>apricot</i>. Rabelais used the word
<i>abricot fendu</i> when speaking of the female genital organs. See his
works. Was this term derived from the Biblical narrative of the genesis
of the human race (the apple), or was it taken from the phallic symbol,
the pomegranate? Did Moses get it from the Assyrians in the first place?
I think he did.</p></div>

As has been pointed out elsewhere in this work, ancient peoples were
essentially symbolical and materialistically symbolical at that; they
were very apt to typify nature, sexually, by some object or objects
which bore a resemblance real or fancied, to the sexual organs. The red
halves of the ripe apricot at the insertion of the stem, look very much
like the external genitalia of the human female. The significance and
importance of the pomegranate in the mixed religion of the Ancient
Hebrews are well brought out in rules laid down for the ornamentations
and embroidery of the robes of the priests, etc., etc., <i>Vid. Old

A modification of this is seen in the derisive gesture of the street
Arab who closes all of his fingers, except the middle one, on his palm.
The middle finger he holds stiffly erect and the hand is then extended
towards the object of his contempt. This gesture, once performed as a
deeply religious rite, has now become the contemptuous sign of a boy of
the street!</p></div>

According to Abel de R&eacute;musat (<i>Nouv. Mel. Asiatiques</i>, p. 116),
the custom of <i>tchin-than</i>, or religious defloration, was formerly in
use in Cambodia and Malabar. This custom seems to be analogous to the
<i>jus primae noctis</i>, as practiced by many tribes, where the woman, on
her bridal night, has to yield herself up to the male marriage
guests&mdash;<i>jus primae noctis</i>, as thus practiced, must not be
confounded with the seignorial right, the right of the lord, or ruler.
The former right is regarded in the light of a <i>quasi</i> religious
observance, while the latter is not. The former was in vogue in ancient
times in the Balearic Isles and among the ancient Peruvians; recently
among several aboriginal tribes of India, in Burmah, in Cashmere, in
Madagascar, in Arabia, and in New Zealand. Vid. Teulon: <i>Orig. de la

The phallic hand in some form or other is frequently found in the ruins
of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The so-called <i>maison d&rsquo; joie</i> found
in one of the streets of Pompeii is considered by some authorities to
have been a minor temple to Venus where priapic rites were celebrated.
The stone phallus at the entrance as well as the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original read 'errotic'.">erotic</ins>

A recent writer, Dr. Lydston, expresses surprise that the brothel should
occupy such a prominent place in the ancient chronicles. When the
universality and high honor of phallic worship is taken into
consideration, the entertainment of the &ldquo;Captain of the
Host&rdquo; in a brothel ceases to be a matter or cause for surprise;
the prominence given such entertainment by the ancient historians is
perfectly natural and to be expected. <i>Compare</i> Lydston: <i>The Diseases
